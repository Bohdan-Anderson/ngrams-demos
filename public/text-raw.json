{"data":"good morning John in August of 2019 the New York Times published an article that was titled why hate speech on the Internet is a never-ending problem because this law Shields the law in question was section 230 of the communications decency act later that day they published The Following retraction an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the law that protects hate speech on the internet the First Amendment not section 230 of the communications decency act protects it now this is kind of funny it's also kind of not especially if you know the long history of people misunderstanding section 230 and what it means it is very difficult for all of us to figure out how to adjust to the power that the internet wields and when we're doing that it's pretty easy to look toward what's probably the most important piece of legislation in the history of the internet which was passed as part of a much larger bill when Mark Zuckerberg was 11 years old and then when he was 12 years old almost all of that law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court but they left one section section 230 which says among other things this no provider or user of an interactive Computer Service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider to explain right now I am the other information content provider and YouTube is the provider of the interactive Computer Service and so if I slander someone or try to recruit someone to my terrorist cell or otherwise do something illegal you can sue or find or imprison me you can't hold YouTube liable for what I said this thing section 230 is kind of what made it possible for the many to many internet thing to exist which is good but also bad it's the thing that we love about the internet and it's the thing that we hate about the internet right now the Supreme Court is hearing a case against YouTube that argues that YouTube is not liable for the content in the videos on its platform but it is liable for the recommendations of that content to people if the YouTube algorithm recommends terrorist recruitment videos to YouTube users it isn't just hosting content it's also kind of creating a new kind of content which is the recommendation and that seems a little bit right to me the problem though is where do you draw the line for what counts as a recommendation is a Google search a list of recommendations that Google is making to me does that mean that every internet platform that has a recommendation system of any kind meaning all of them are they liable for what they recommended if they are does the internet work at all it looks like the Supreme Court will not find YouTube liable in this case which I think is good but the reality is that there is something of a difference between the front page of YouTube being algorithmically generated for each individual user and me searching for something and getting recommended results and maybe there's a difference between those two things and chat GPT creating content that I will then read that was nonetheless created by a machine there's definitely a way to see recommendation as creation I just don't think that a law passed in 1996 did a good job of anticipating that and actually I think that that law had a tremendous amount of foresight and has served us fairly well there was a moment when the Supreme Court was talking about this when Justice Kagan said something that I want to play for you now you know every other industry has to internalize the costs of misconduct why is it that the tech industry gets a pass on the other hand I mean we're a court we really don't know about these things you know these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet the implication being we probably shouldn't be trying to figure this stuff out based on 26 words that were written in 1996. it should be decided by passing new legislation that considers the internet as it exists now which is pretty different from when there are interactive Computer Services I think that we're actually pretty dang lucky that section 230 supported the creation of this new tool of many-to-many communication which has I admit drawbacks but I don't think anybody's figured out like a good and simple way to tease all the bad parts out from the good parts and the times that we've attempted to do that haven't had great outcomes it's very hard to legislate for a world that changes this quickly so if it feels sometimes like we don't know how to do this it's because we don't know how to do it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John and welcome to the project for awesome 2023 meme review during the project for awesome people make things and then they submit them to the project for awesome art folder including this music that you're hearing right now from ickle there was a whole album of techno vlogbrother stuff I'm still pretty hyped for awesome and the two cups of black tea that I just had five count them five folders on my desktop that I have filled with stuff relying on the fact that I have two years in a row gotten permission to make extra long videos I'm gonna do that starting of course since it's a meme review with the folder labeled memes just like the project for awesome there is no Rhyme or Reason to this you just start somewhere in the middle and you put the peeps in the bean can and add the Dr Pepper all these powerful white men are are laughing at John Green because they put the Dr Pepper on Peeps and at that point you have to do it I don't know if I've said this before but I actually wrapped like gift wrapped the peeps and it said project for awesome day one open on day one and then my son thought it was a present for him and he opened it at John house and just started eating them sound financial decisions and me being held back by sending two middle-aged guys to a restaurant it's twenty dollars and we are gonna make it worth it everywhere I go I see his face look I'm not necessarily proud I did buy way too many oh geez I just spilled pickle juice on myself it wasn't totally sealed well I do still have my paper towels because it's project for awesome and the most important thing is paper look at how many paper towels I used let's just all take a moment to be grateful for Catherine green anyway I bought too many pickles as all I wanted to say just putting beans in the bean home I've got a bean shirt on and a banana Loca in one hand and a corn dog in the other any cylindrical food is on the table I did buy hot dogs this year and I didn't end up using them next year project for awesome audience just watching me slapping Dr Pepper baked beads on an unsuspecting pickle Hank Green slurping Dr Pepper beans from a banana Loca doesn't exist and can't hurt you oh yeah you think so and I had to get them out somehow I don't know I feel like everyone was having a good time and I stand by the fact that a Twinkie filled with Dr Pepper baked beans is better than a Twinkie knot filled with Dr Pepper baked beans this is in reference to the auction that we had for Ryan Reynolds Deadpool screen worn watch me and Ray were in a tight battle and then Ben came out of the last second Chow this is great because it does look like he's joking but he is not joking Dustin was responsible for the largest single hour of the project for awesome this year support the project for Awesome by watching the live stream by voting on videos by donating by getting married and moving to North Dakota that's a deep cut but that was a fun part of the stream guests are ready signal strong donation steady made a donation to the project already Hank's confetti if you got the confetti perk I've ordered some special stickers to close these up with I'm just waiting on that and then they'll go out to you me before crabilis me after I get a premium subscription to have a crab in my inbox every month I love this because I know the screen cap that this video is from because Oren and I watch it together all the time and we dance Captain Crunch Gotta Love any amount of Darcy that gets into the memes me and John on both crunched a lemon and it was bad both times crunch uh looking at Darcy crunching a carrot instead of me crunching a lemon and look I don't know I feel like I put more into that than Darcy did you can't defeat me humans I know but she can that's right Darcy crunching carrots was responsible for us breaking through the two million dollar barrier this wasn't like the first moments of the project for awesome where I was like I guess it's begun I'm gonna make a hole in the bottom of a peep that's Dr Pepper flavor and filled with beans we didn't have to hit a goal to get there or anything I just couldn't stop myself and I don't know that John liked it for every ten thousand dollars we will reward Darcy with carrots Nerdfighters Max Max Max so his spaceship is very good friendship ended with beans now hummus is my best friend we that was the first mention of hummus of this whole meme review I don't know if anybody was happy to see the banana Loca come back weirdly I now have two because I was gifted one by a friend who didn't know I had one who knew that I would want one so I'm like this in real life I a little bit like the part where you don't like it like you have to know that right I tried to Crunch a carrot as good as Darcy I don't actually think I did I think I did a worse job so the story behind the hummus is that it turns out one of the stock notification sounds in slack is just a woman saying a hummus I changed it because people donated for me to change it and I left it that way for the entire project for rasa but I did mute the more active slack channels and before I did that there was a lot of hummus happening it was a little overwhelmed yeah like this and like that and like that doing 20 on something I need spending twenty dollars so two guys can go to a racks I don't know if you needed that but I think that we all needed that yeah they knew ultimately it is a little hard for it not to be a problem tummy time the project for awesome but we work through it I'm gonna donate for a perk that is so being filled you don't actually get any Bean filled perks that's not that's not available yet maybe next year adding a citrus crunching a almond I don't know if it was supposed to be lemon but it says Ramen and that's great never ask a woman her age a man his salary Hank wear the slip of paper from the balloon win I never found it maybe it's like in one of these cracks or it like flew into the bookshelf somewhere I never found it someday I will we had to vote on who the mascot of the 2023 project for awesome lesson T-Rex clobbered hummus Lemon Lips man was the other option uh it wasn't even close this is great because the meme is referencing itself fantastic work John cannot be quiet about tuberculosis at the moment but God bless him for it John I love you for who you are oh yeah when I crunch the limb and my lips swelled up and I looked like this guy from Monsters Inc also last year I had to pretend to be a crab this year I had to pretend to be a cute little housefly and both times it definitely hurt my knees I did decide that the phone a friend task was too easy so I taped my phone to my phone which also might be part of the reason why my knee hurts this is part of the story of this year's project for awesome we decide like we had to commit the bit we had to make it a priority it's been too long we've talked about racks and not been to a racks we're gonna go to Rex which might be a problem for our pants but we're gonna do it anyway are we gonna talk about why Rax is bad for your pants it's very deep it's too deep it's time to go was I a good restaurant no you ruined pants I don't even really know where it came from this is great because it's destined on the moon and he's Mr T which is tuberculosis racks T-Rex is as well hello the moon you can eat here it's everything it's got everything all at once marked safe from beans on a peeps you're not you're never safe the two Vibes of the project for awesome are a little bit contradictory but I think they come together very well someone accidentally bid 42 000 for the watch and we had to roll it back but luckily we were able to do that stay up to date on your vaccinations the internet's hottest club is the p4a live stream this place has everything Bean filled pickles the word hummus fast food restaurant chain rack honestly that list could have gone on way longer and not gotten any less weird big Lemon Lips a Furby made of beans and dinosaurs going to the Moon if you don't know about Stefan this doesn't make sense but that's okay who would win famous science educator or a puzzle of electric rap the puzzle of the electric rat one I actually found the piece that I couldn't find after the stream ending you think you're gonna get beans no you mostly get slack hummus and beans though baked beans no lemons no lemon baked beans I put a little bit of lemon juice in the Dr Pepper baked beans and it was way it was so good it was way better it needed something to cut that sugar is there a world where I could give Paul Hollywood a pickle stuffed with baked beans because I feel like that would be an achievement Destin kept saying tataria which I understand it looks like tataria now that I'm looking at it to ataria is how it's pronounced I like that spaceship that's a nice spaceship sorry you're memeing the concept of hummus and it was a good mascot maybe just not the best they are both the p4re I cannot disagree Hey look it's the part where I had my phone taped to my foot and I called my friend Joe just drowning in hummus I couldn't make it out who would win one Hank Green or one lemon boy one lemon boy would win oh no was I just whining about my knee the whole time I'm sure I was and that's the end that's the end of the memes everybody time to move on to the next folder none of them are going to be anywhere as long as the memes but we do have one folder that's just called hummus this almost ended up in the art folder because it's beautiful oh my God it's hummus hummus Hank trying to raise money for charity the trains coming by it says Hamas listening for hummus by Hank Green special 16th anniversary edition number one inside joke for nerdfighteria of project for awesome 2023 evocative hummus meme Iraq's being dipped into hummus this person knitted a hummus thing hummus we're hummus because we're hummus and finally a hummus Furby and not the last one you'll see today what's our next folder called you ask it's called T-Rex and it's just rack stuff this is a baby picture of me taking the place of another child who was in a racks commercial deep cut well done Mr delicious as a T-Rex on the earth so big he's going to space he's almost at the Moon little T-Rex saying hummus it was well established that T-Rex only eats hummus and is a vegetarian Hank and John's rack silent Adventure ruin your pants be excellent to each other that is absolutely what I would look like in a crop top

here I am with a lemon in my mouth riding on Mr D as a T-Rex I don't know why I have so many tattoos racks you can eat here endless hummus bar this folder is just lemon stuff but there's only four things in it I think I got confused halfway through but here it is this is a lemon crab saying hummus and I think it's crank green so it's also me if only it we're also a dinosaur I didn't feel bad for the lemon before but I do a little bit now you don't have to understand that joke but there it is and finally this it's a crab with lemon lips and my glasses and it's got my press on nails turns out impossible to play guitar with the press on nails on your string fingers and we cap it all off with the last folder on my desktop this one is just labeled art it's just art it's things that were

big scary flying man I have a lot of little hairs I would love to get into carrot business just so we can make organic Darcy crunch carrots um good be weird do good if that's not the project for awesome I don't know what is for at some point I pretended to be a crab while doing Shakespeare I forgot about that until this moment this is just my very large face with the word beans superimposed over it because this is becoming my brand Eternal salad bar what a beautiful but creepy racks very Twin Peaks Justin going to the Moon in his spaceship car five foot nine brown eyes and a sundress which is just a Deering and John joke it's this that's nothing to do with the project for us I don't know if many people would buy hummus if this was The Branding but I know that I would we have to stop saying now we're cooking with gas we need to stop cooking with gas and it's not even as good as solar powered induction I could definitely see this on a t-shirt but then you'd have to explain it to people hummus somebody made a winter project for awesome cookies there's T-Rex there's crunching there's a bean pickle there's crank green look delicious really lovely we're here because we are here spiral I don't know how you do that that well little darsiered watercolor a little crabulous 2.0 no watercolor a little Lemon Lips watercolor tuberculosis focused Endeavor project for awesome

a feather boa and some big old lips beautiful project for awesome mandala again another quite creepy Rex image it's starting to feel kind of threatening with the Eternal salad bar this color pencil T-Rex is so huge he's got a head of hair which you just don't see on dinosaurs very often many of these things seem like they would have taken more than two days to do but I don't know I don't like I don't know how I've never made anything like this I have no idea how hard it is to make but it seems very difficult Lemon Lips no hips that's me Hank Green a bean peep a bunch of dogs pee for a you can cry here it's in the founding documents it's not required but it is encouraged I mean we did the coffee club we did the sock Club what's next this is gorgeous and must have taken a very long time had to be more than just a project for us a project for awesome vision board you just keep cramming stuff in because more weird things are gonna happen this is so cute he's wonderful that's art right I don't like what am I supposed to say T-Rex eating hummus and destroying pants will Darcy carrot very cute Tony orange I couldn't remember Ted lasso's name and I knew that his last name was a noun

just to notice a bunch of dinosaurs I did break an egg over my head I did immediately regret it maybe they were trying to predict that I would write butts on my head but I didn't Sharpie face at all this yes it's a beautiful self-care bunny well I love you card and there's a crank green inside of it down in the bottom of the heart so cute another doodle Board of things going on you are on earth and no one can take that away from you Hank Green's hunky chasa 100 a profit to charity we're queer because we're queer very nice t-shirt design that's lemon it's not having a good time I wasn't

what to say about this what's up with the giant space dinosaur I don't know it's going to the Moon obviously this is so great I love this it's so adorable dinosaurs in space Gumball Mike of course John Green getting Sharpie faced into from like a sort of Sigmund Freud character here all the way to a very punk rock figure and then there's Hank Green Lemon Lips no hips again this is very good but literally no hips in this situation and I love that p4a logo you made you are a Dino on the moon and no one can take that away from you and green in my new book The anthropubine refilled build can Edition my goodness and then the beans in my pickle by crank Green Oh I think all these were done by the same person so I don't know who it was but thank you it was genius crotch Tony orange again P for a plus I think that's basically the uh the digital download bundle AS p4a Plus and then of course there's this hanger fish crunching a lemon he's lovely and he's made a mistake certainly one of the greatest pieces of project for awesome art this year was these two long Furbies one is a lemon hummus long Furby and the other is a bean pickle long Furby with the crack in it that the beans are coming out of which did happen to my pickle it's not really anything more perfect than that I bought this as a sticker and I'm gonna put it on my laptop because I love my life we're hummus because we're a lemon crab with gigantic lips a lot of people make little compilation images of their whole weekend I love them this was a nice one a nice little Lemon Lips logo I had the Lemon Lips John Green watercolor sketch this little baby meeting it's Mommy strong sad with a crab playing with them you can't explain but it was a nice moment I really feel like it was the road to racks like it's a video game level one we have to fight that giant Dr Pepper peep then we gotta fight the bean pickle then we gotta fight the Lemon Lips and then we gotta fight just a bunch of coffee beans because at one point I did just eat raw coffee beans and then last you gotta fight Tyrannosaurus Rex cause it turns out maybe a lot of the beauty Aesthetics of that time came from thinking that people with consumption were extra hot it froze on John's face when he was making that frowny face he was it was like that for like a full 30 seconds and it was such a perfect meme face it's absolutely beautiful so you could just drink cap that for any any use that you want we're here because we're here but it spells out hummus raising nerdy to the power of awesome be weird do good and it's a T-Rex at the Rex new item Lemon Lips and it's just roaring out hummus and finally the first piece of art I saw and the last one I will show you today is this 3D art of beans stuffed inside of a Dr Pepper pea it was a truly magical project for awesome there were so many ridiculous beautiful memorable moments there was this I'll never forget that it was like I did a magic trick but I none of it was on purpose not even the confetti stuck to the balloon there are a lot of ways to find meaning and purpose in this world but the project for awesome is one that we kind of made up from scratch and it is just ever so good I'm so grateful to all of you who were a part of it in whatever way you were and of course I'm also very grateful to you John we had a really good time it was a good old time and now now I have to figure out how to take all my lights down without getting them all tangled and John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John doing something a little different today it's officially countdown time to project for us I set this video to Premiere so theoretically there are a bunch of people watching all at once right now and they're all in the chat together just chanting butt farting butt Fartman butt Fartman over and over again trying to summon him we'll see if that works if you don't know who butt Fartman is or beanie sandverbs or crank green or Dave the fish or Glenn of the Glenn and Dale of the Dale don't worry that's okay they're all mascots of former projects for awesome not this one what's gonna be the mascot of this project for awesome no one knows you don't know until you start and then immediately I turn into a crab for some reason and this happens which is great no one doesn't like this I didn't even realize we were making mascots for the project for awesome until last year after we had had like over a dozen of them and I don't remember the origin stories they all have origin stories if you're gonna read any of them you should read butt fartman's [Music] excellent well done everyone you can stop chanting now you successfully summoned him now in the chat or in comments if you're late you could just type in the best parts of the project for awesome according to you now you'd think that a 48-hour live stream dedicated to fixing the unfixable problems of humanity and Earth would not be so goofy this is actually something I've noticed quite a bit if you sort of know about the problems and you look at the problems and you say oh that's problem is problem that is somber it's not fun but in the moments when I see people actually working on hard problems ideally together in community with others the recognition of the magnitude of the problem is still there that didn't go away but also it just becomes human community and human Community is all of the things that humans always are whether that is silly or goofy or sad or serious or depressed or anxious or joyful or whatever it's not joyful in spite of the fact that it's directly interfacing with you know some of the greatest challenges that Humanity has to face it's joyful because it isn't like glancing at those things and then being ashamed that they exist it's just accepting that they are and that nothing can ever be perfect but we can work hard and when we work together we can magnify our impact which this year is already building off of over seven hundred thousand dollars in matching grants so if we can raise seven hundred thousand dollars during the project for awesome all of those initial dollars will be matched and we will be at 1.4 million dollars so recognizing the flaws in our world and then witnessing our combined impact yeah it's gonna be a little bit joyful and then you add in the sleep deprivation and you know you get what you get so during the first half of the project for awesome we will again be raising money for Partners in Health and save the children these are two organizations that work to make life better for some of the people who have the very least on our planet and they both do it in ways that build strong foundations for those communities the idea being that those people want to work hard for themselves and their families and their communities they want to help each other out there are things that weigh on those communities lack of Access to Health Care and education not having enough food or clean water we know from evidence from experience that if you give people the resources and a strong foundation on which to build they will build during the second half of the project for awesome the money will go to registered non-profits that are voted on by this community so we divide that up and we split it amongst 20 to 30 non-profits depending on how much we rate people all over have made videos talking about the great work that non-profits that they know about do those videos were submitted to project for awesome.com we'll watch some of them during the live stream but you can also just watch them on the website now and if you like the pitch you could vote on the Charities at project for awesome.com donate you will find a little rewards button you'll click on that and there'll be a lot of rewards you can scroll and scroll and find all the different things that are available and they're very good there's so much and we will talk about all of it at project for awesome.com live which is where you should go the moment this video ends which is right now John I'll see you there good morning John uh there's something about this isn't there Catherine turned to me after finishing your video from this week and she said I was engaged but I was relaxed I think the way we normally do these videos like isn't precisely that I mean I'm not gonna stop doing it this way I like this way this is the way this is the way but I don't think it's relaxing and like I'm getting older maybe the level of energy needs to come down a little bit sometimes a hamstring has to be the most ridiculously named muscle right there can't be a worse one than that Cath is weird like it's just uh somebody looked at that and was like that looks like a small cow but at least kath is like a living animal if it were called a veal string then I'd be like yeah that's equally ridiculous to hamstring that's that's the basic of the situation we're in with hamstring that's got to be the weirdest one I've been working on project for awesome perks because it's uh it's going up quick for the last four or five years we've been making various kinds of spray paint art where we've been using stencils on glass or canvas and when we were doing that we also made something by accident every year I used the same roll of paper as the drop cloth so he wouldn't get paint on whatever surface we were painting on and over the years that paper became really beautiful like it had all the stencil marks and then it had scuffs and Footprints and some of it started to rip and it was just like clear that we weren't going to use this paper again and and I literally like looked down at it in the dumpster and I was like I I can't throw that away I took it home and I cut out squares uh and then I graffiti mopped hangler fish on a bunch of them and they are the hanger fish art this year and they're all signed and numbered there's 250 of them and I'm excited to share them with people and of course it's the only time we're going to be able to do ones like this because that paper doesn't exist anymore it's a pretty good trade though I think and next year I'll have to figure out something else to do I'm not sure if that's not an optimistic or depressing um but I guess that's what figuring out something else to do is both of those things so I have a friend she's a pretty good friend and I go over to her place fairly frequently um and uh and she knows my name which is weird that I mentioned that go over to her place once to to meet a new member of her family she's got a new dog it's extremely cute brand new dog didn't exist a couple months ago and she's like this is Hank meet Hank uh what what am I supposed to do with this like either this is an odd honor that is being bestowed on me or you forgot I existed this isn't a dog that came from the pound with a name this is a new dog that you had an infinite number of names that you could have given I'm not personally a name dogs human names kind of person I my dog was named lemon my cats have been named Cameo and gummy bear we don't run into that problem very often when someone shows up and they're like oh my name's gummy bear too you can do it I just think like avoid the names of people who are going to be at your house a lot and soon sorry it's true if you're watching this um just know that I never said anything and then it just sort of pinged around in there for years until this I forgot about gluteus maximus gluteus maximus is definitely the most ridiculous name for a gluteus maximus like your butt is the emperor of Rome gluteus maximus runs [Music] and [Music] I like to say if it ain't folk don't Blix it it's just funnier John I'll see you tomorrow good morning John surprise it's me I'm here on the channel I thought I was getting a colonoscopy today but it turns out that I'm not you'd think that's something I would know I scheduled one and then I started a new medicine and then they wanted to push it back but then I didn't take it off my schedule so I have one in May it's fine you don't need to know but that means I had a whole extra day which is great because I have a lot to do put on a presentation about titles and thumbnails thinking about redesigning my office I got a couple of updates I need to send out to the community here project for awesome is coming I think I might have like a mild existential crisis about halfway through the day I need to get lunch at some point I might just make a sandwich first the subscriptions system that we use to run the awesome socks club and coffee and also Pizza Miss stuff they had a weird glitch so it may have sent you an email that you're gonna get skipped for this month you won't uh we're working on a fix uh sorry that shouldn't happen again as a man once said still some glitches to work out and I really am grateful because people are so understanding when stuff like this happens so thanks for that I'm so excited about how well those things have done we've got you know thousands of people getting coffee every month and tens of thousands of people getting socks every month it makes me think a lot about what's possible and thinking a lot about what's possible these days often requires me to think about what is impossible which is me doing more stuff which is a shame because I very much love to do more stuff I'm sure that's something no one's ever noticed about me also the project for awesome is approaching rapidly February 17th and video submissions are open we used to do it everybody would upload the video on the same day YouTube doesn't really care about that anymore so you can upload it beforehand get it into our system and then we can review the videos and pick out ones that we might want to feature during the project for awesome live stream so if you want to make your project for awesome video do that and then submit it at project for awesome.com if you don't know what I'm talking about the project for awesome is a yearly 48-hour live stream that John and I and friends have been doing since 2007. we raise money we send people things in exchange for that money both physical and digital things there's a whole campaign that will be live during the live stream during the first half we raise money for save the children and Partners in Health and during the second half we raise money for organizations voted on by the community and we decide that by watching videos that people make talking about the great work that organizations they care about do in their community and in the world so if you want to make a video supporting your favorite charity you can do that it doesn't have to be more than a minute long tell us about the problem that organization is interfacing with why it's a big deal and how they're trying to solve that problem that's that's the basic format of most YouTube videos about anything what is the problem why is it important what should we do about it that's so much of what humans do and it's a good format it's a reason why we do things that way I don't know which of the things that I do is the most important one or even which one I enjoy the most so that's like a weird thing for a bunch of chemical reactions to think I'm also going to be doing the nerdfighteria census fairly soon so if you haven't filled out the survey there's a link in the description to do that so that we can get more data about how people are feeling about nerdfighteria it's good to get a broad base of information from all across this community so that's in the description as well and what else is going on Catherine and I have been having a good old time with delete this lately we kind of fell into a new format called wet or dry where we talk about one wet thing and one dry thing and then try and figure out which of the things is better it sounds like a terrible idea for a podcast but it's maybe my best idea for a podcast ever it's very fun and it's been very silly it maybe is not for kids though just FYI I mostly mentioned that so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening and hydrogen isn't it interesting that there is an element where if you take away the electron it's just a proton it's still hydrogen that's how it works elements are defined by the number of protons they have and hydrogen has one proton so if there's just one proton it's hydrogen that's cool I don't know why it takes me out of the frame a little bit additional thing to share Hank's Channel got one of these so that see that's you right there you see yourself that's you that's what you look like to me it's not how I think of you anyway I have no idea which of the things that I just said is going to fit in this video definitely not all of it that's for sure John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John one thing I think people sense but I don't say that often is that I feel a pretty strong obligation to do good and interesting things with the tools that I have and probably the two most impactful uh things that I have easy access to are one this audience this group of people this community who have supported a lot of very good and interesting things over the years and then the second probably most powerful tool is the people who work at and the things that have been made by complexly all of the things I have been referring to as tools are human beings but yeah I hope you understand what I mean crash course in particular has become a pretty interesting thing in the world of educational media which has resulted in lots of people like knock it on our doors to see if they can invest or partner with us in various ways a lot and to figure out what to do with an asset like that all you really have to do is to sort of understand the entire problem landscape of all of global education so that should be fine but a few years back we did decide to start walking down a road like this and it did start with a lot of trying to figure out what the problems that students in the US in particular face how to imagine those barriers and how to lower them obviously I don't know much about that I'm a YouTuber with a background in Biochemistry so it involved talking to a lot of people who are actually in higher education because we wanted to have a kind of thing that sort of supported people on their Bridge from high school to college in the U.S so for a little bit of context right now at a state school it costs about twelve hundred dollars for a three credit course you can also get credits while you are in high school but sometimes those credits don't transfer indeed lots of these credits don't transfer easily from school to school and figure out when and how they do is a big messy mess and that is just one part of the big messy mess that is the entire education bureaucracy that is more complicated if you have fewer resources and also you probably have less access to information or fewer people who are around you who've been through the system before so as we were doing our research we identified that as actually one of the main barriers that some people just don't know a lot about how this system works and that can result in costly mistakes the other like main big barrier though which is the one that people most often cite when they drop out of school is cost it's just that it costs a lot of money at some point in the last five years some folks at YouTube introduced us to some folks at Arizona State University which is a large public research University with a specific goal of judging itself not by like its rejection rates and how exclusive they are but by how many people they can include in their school so after a lot of conversations and a lot of work from a lot of people we ended up with a thing that's called study hall study hall has like four main parts right now there's fast guides which is like a guide to what different college majors are about what they do for you what people end up doing usually once you get them how to college which is just a crash course on how College Works College foundations which are videos that cover foundational college courses that tons of people have to take and finally a thing that just launched this week at gostudyhall.com which is a way of going from those College foundations course to an actual course that you're taking online that you can get transferable college credit for from Arizona State University the videos are of course still free on YouTube but if you want to take the course you start out by paying 25 once you've signed up and the course Begins the first one begins on March 7th you could take the class with a cohort of students with faculty support and at the end of the course if you think that the course did a good job of teaching you and you like the grade that you got you can pay 400 for a transferable college credit so basically we're providing an option to get foundational course knowledge and transferable credits from a major research institution with more flexibility and at a lower cost and like I kind of can't believe that's real the goal is not to replace college with YouTube videos it's to look closely at the barriers and lower the ones that we can I wish we could fix the whole system with one sweeping action but as long as we can't do that we gotta do what we can with what we have so if you know folks that might be interested in this please tell them about it and of course thank you so much to the dozens of people who have been working on this in one way or another for years now who are at complexly or ASU or at YouTube I'm so proud of the work that we've done and I'm so excited to have it out there John I'll see you on Tuesday not making a video next week instead I'm gonna get a colonoscopy so just so you know that ah my goodness good morning John so I've noticed that for the last few videos you are basically doing just whatever I am doing I did low budget Bo Burnham you did a low budget Bo Burnham I did a Google autofill thing you did a Google autofill thing I think this is cheating or at least lazy and so I am going to make it hard for you by taking you behind the scenes to one of the most advanced aquarium exhibits in the whole world I actually got to tour this exhibit before it actually existed to see the complexity of what makes it all come together because you'd think okay an aquarium on the coast that can't be that complicated pump seawater in put fish in the sea water and it's beautiful well it is more complicated than that than three years ago I actually made a whole video about it and you can watch it but not all ocean is the same in particular it's very different at different depths and there are animals in the deep sea that basically no one gets to see it's extremely hard to go down there it's also hard to get the animals to the surface and once they're at the surface the sea water is so different from the water of the deep sea that they cannot survive in it but at the mount Monterey Bay Aquarium they wanted people to be able to walk amongst the animals of the deep sea just to exist in the same space system and if you go to that exhibit which I have not been able to do yet you can do just that you are in the dark walking through Halls surrounded by animals that typically inhabit the most difficult to visit place on Earth and it is designed to appear to the people walking through the exhibit that that's all fairly effortless it's just something for you to enjoy not for you to understand the engineering behind how it is possible but before the exhibit opened I got to see how that seemingly effortless cohabitation between humans and deep sea animals is actually extremely complicated and fairly precarious so look when I walked into this I thought the hardest part of this process was going to be pressurizing the water to the same pressures as the deep sea because water is very heavy and down at the bottom of the ocean there is a lot of water on top of you enough pressure to very easily kill you but I you know I need to exist at a certain pressure of atmospheric pressure in order to exist and the difference between the ocean pressure at the bottom of the sea and the ocean pressure at the top of the sea is bigger than the difference between air pressure at sea level and space but many deep sea creatures don't have very much gas inside of them so if you bring them up slowly enough they'll be fine so if you don't actually have to pressurize the water what's the concern the trouble is that the sea water itself is different it has higher salinity very consistent low temperature and really consistent gas concentrations that are very different from surface level water and so behind every wall at into the deep there are systems that take water from Monterey Bay and turn it into a simulation of deep sea water and it turns out the hardest part of this is removing the perfect amount of oxygen oxygen is great but it is also a super reactive molecule and these animals are used to an environment with a super low oxygen concentration the oxygen of surface sea level would absolutely kill many of them and so all of the water in this aquarium must be run through a equipment that was designed I'm not kidding for Semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing among other things situations where they really need to control the amount of different chemicals present in a system by running the water over tons of tiny thin membrane straws with very low pressure inside the oxygen basically gets sucked out of the water flowing into the area of lower oxygen but of course they can't take out too much or the animals will asphyxiate it has to be perfectly balanced every hour of every day I cannot go to the deep sea and I probably shouldn't I should leave that to the researchers who are dedicated to understanding and protecting it but the people at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and places like them have worked extremely hard to bring those environments those other worlds within our own to as many of us as they can to inspire wonder and joy and awe at the marvels of our planet and the Curiosity and Ingenuity of the people who inhabit it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John thanks for joining me in our brand new format which I'm sure we will bring back again but today instead of that I'm back in the old space and I'm going to do an old format this one is the one where you ask Google what questions people have been asking by starting to ask it a question and not finish good old Google autocomplete why is there an egg shortage well broadly it is because we build many systems for efficiency rather than resilience if you want to make a lot of eggs really cheap you got to have one very big room with a whole lot of chickens in it but that's also a fantastic circumstance for the transmission of disease like bird flu in order to control diseases Farmers have to kill all of the birds in a facility when one bird gets bird flu and then disinfect the whole place over 60 million birds have been killed in the current bird flu outbreak and that decreases the number of eggs on the market while demand stays roughly the same five dollars for a dozen eggs is a lot of money compared to what we were spending this time last year but a dollar 33 for a dozen eggs which is what we were spending this time last year is a price that some would argue should be a little bit bit higher to allow for more resiliency in that system why is the sky blue the white light that comes from the sun is made of a bunch of different wavelengths that all look different colors to us the gases in our atmosphere are good at scattering blue wavelengths out of the white light so the sun with the blue ticking out looks a little bit yellow while the sky with a blue scattering around looks like blue but as I have said before the sky doesn't exist It's Just an Illusion a kind of one colored rainbow why is my poop green could be a lot of different things uh probably something you ate either it's a bunch of green vegetable stuff or green food coloring or maybe some antibiotics or different medications will turn your poop green if it's accompanied by diarrhea or other symptoms that have been going on for multiple days go see a doctor I'm not a doctor and neither is the internet why is my eye twitching I don't know same though maybe it's because of the this we don't actually know why I was twitched though it's definitely correlated with fatigue and stress and if you don't have one or the other or both of those well done I'm just I'm loving that for you I'm not I'm fine why is the flag at half mass in the U.S and probably other places definitely Canada now that I found this clip when mourning something we often put the flag only halfway up this is sometimes because of like big National tragedies that are in the news but it's also often because of the death of a member of the government or some public servant and it varies from state to state flag Express which sells flags keeps track of this on their website so you can always know if you want to why is my poop black this is significantly more concerning and less common than green poop you should probably go see a doctor immediately it could be because you're bleeding somewhere in your GI tract why is it called Black Friday well At the moment I'm thinking it has something to do with poop but I know that that can't be right so I'll look it up I guess I looked it up and I'm gonna be honest with you it's boring it's like oh there's a lot of traffic on the day after Thanksgiving on the roads people didn't like that why is JJ Watt retiring I don't know man that sounds like a pretty personal question why is these diesel so expensive well it's taxed a little bit higher so that makes it a little bit more expensive also recently we started to require in the US low sulfur diesel because of the human health consequences of having all that sulfur in the air the biggest reason is that when you have a barrel of crude oil the part that can get turned into gasoline is fairly big and it's more flexible that part can be used for a bunch of different stuff that's like high value and low value and you can sort of mix up the market based on what's most needed and most expensive well the part that can get turned into diesel is smaller and the stuff it can get turned into is more valuable than diesel like jet fuel so there's just more higher value demand for the diesel fraction of the crude which drives up the price and our final question in the Google autocomplete list why is my dog shaking and gosh I don't know that that sounds scary I'm sorry about your dog it could be stress anxiety nervousness cold excitement but if this is a new thing and you're worried about it again I'm not a doctor of animals or people so maybe you should go see the vet John after 16 years I still love making videos with you why is this so much fun I don't know but I like it and I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John this is a weird way to make a video I recently fell down while ice skating I didn't fall down actually I dove in front of Oren to make him laugh because I will do anything to see that little kid smile ankle on my hip stayed like in the same place just sort of like right in line with each other but unfortunately my need not occupy any space inside of that line um so that hurts and now I'm squatting this is probably an observation people have made about Los Angeles before but but it's very weird that they're a lot a lot of advertisement tens of millions of dollars of advertisements that are asking me to consider a film or television show for awards Sarah 9921 members of The Academy so each one of those ads is for an audience of less than ten thousand the thing is it must work like they wouldn't do it if it didn't work but how many people that kind of sway so it was really it's not even about the 9921 it's about the like 45 people who might change their votes based on seeing this thing if you could just find those 45 people and give them each a million dollars it would be the same thing all because there's that much economic value I'm now I'm doing stand-up comedy except I'm not I'm just doing stand-up like upset it's a lot of stand-up comedy these days was really just stand up upset I'm gonna do squat down upsettity that's give me loving like I could make a really bad joke uh and everybody'd be like ah but on artificial intelligence makes a really bad joke and everybody loses their minds but this makes sense because if I ask you what like 522 times 8 divided by 64 is no like you don't know if the computer does that not a big deal but if you do that in front of me everybody would lose their minds like I would be like oh like when computers could first do those math problems was it like that were people that freaked out like the way that we were like write a poem about Gilligan's Island in the style of 50 Cent and it didn't like the I would do it like oh wow people felt when calculators were first already I can see this happening where we're like well yeah I mean of course AI can tell you how to hot wire a car as a Shakespearean sonnet but only if you give it like an ethical dilemma as a reason to tell you why to hotwire a car that's no big deal that's what AI does it's been a month we adapt so fast like we're gonna make a living computer sometime in my life it seems like and that's gonna be like amazing huge news on Friday they'll be like we found alien life in a computer we accidentally did that and then on Wednesday it won't even be like new gossip it'll be the same gossip but 40 years from now would be just like Harry Styles and Taylor Swift doing something and I love it and then a year later it'd be like yes this is my friend Steve he's a computer man he's a man-made of computer and he's my friend and that's not weird we this is what we do I found a sticker let me read you what it says it says Samantha Rose Garrison vampire boy available on all streaming platforms [Music] killing our favorite toys little did you know I haven't been before little did you know I could give you a toy of all the best places [Music] good morning John I know that we said maybe we weren't going to do videos this week but hey I found something that I really wanted to share with you and it is this lid to a tea it's a tea lid from a Boba place and it's specifically a tea lid that you can use for Boba so I guess you can do hot Boba and you would put the Boba straw through this part of the teal and then you got your normal sipping hole here this is the hy90m5 if you want to look it up and there's something very odd about this tea lid and I want to know what's going on and I can't figure out the answer and so I'm turning to the power that I have and should not abuse in this way but please someone to help me figure out what's going on if you take a look at the hy90 M5 can we get a focus you will see that it says heat 110 degrees Celsius that to me is very weird on its own but then also notice that the one and the one are different fonts I'm gonna talk through why I think this is so strange for the hy90m5 to say heat one one zero degrees Celsius and have the ones be in two different fonts first of all tea is made out of liquid water and liquid water cannot get hotter than 100 degrees Celsius so you cannot heat tea hotter than 100 degrees Celsius unless you're changing the pressure unless you are putting it in a pressure vessel and putting a bunch of extra air molecules in there you cannot heat to above 100 degrees Celsius you especially cannot do that in Montana where we're way above sea level but that's not part of the conversation the only thing that makes sense that it means to me is that this beverage is hot like you wanted to re-emphasize the part where it says caution hot across the top you wanted to reemphasize that with the heat of the drink in here is 110 degrees Celsius which to an American does not sound very hot so that's a problem but I understand this lid is not necessarily made for an American audience because it's a bobolin and we haven't been on the Boba train for that long and we certainly haven't been on the hot Boba train for very long I have of course looked this up it's a lid from Taiwan where they use celsius so the only thing that makes sense is that they put heat 110 degrees Celsius just to re-emphasize that this is very hot it's hotter than you think it is it's hotter than boiling water even though that is literally impossible unless it contains pure steam so I want to tell you the incorrect thing that I thought about this I thought that it said heat 110 degrees Celsius because originally it said heat 100 degrees Celsius and then somebody decided to take off one of the zeros and add a one just to totally emphasize that this is hotter than boiling water even though that's not possible then it can't it isn't it isn't but they wanted people to be safe so they added an extra 10 degrees Celsius to an already impossible temperature and when they did that they used a different phone they didn't have access to the original document they had to cut and paste to make it look like it said 110 degrees Celsius in fact if you look very close the bottom of this one is a little bit higher than the bottom of this one so it's definitely Photoshop and the only reason to do that is if you want to make get more clear that this is very hot liquid but I wanted to confirm this so I went on the internet and I looked up the hy90 M5 and John it used to say 120 degrees Celsius it used to say 120 degrees Celsius and they changed it to a lower temperature I assume because some patent like me was like there isn't a way that the t is 120 degrees Celsius it would just be steam it would be gaseous water it would explode and so they lowered it to an also impossible temperature like somebody did that making sure that extra work was done so that no one would be happy if anybody has any theories about how this happened that more accurately explains the given circumstances in ways that are less infuriating please let me know John I hope you're having a wonderful New Year's and I'll see you in 2023 good morning John it is likely my last video of 2015. 2020 to 2022. Juicy crust pins get down it's gonna be 2023 John I'm very grateful to you for sharing some thoughts about my books I remember when the second one was coming out I was like talking to Media about it and stuff and people were like what's this about and I'm terrible at that so I said like the first book I kind of wrote to try and like share more clearly what the internet is actually like and this book though the second one is more like what I think it's gonna be like and it is legitimately weird to watch as various parallels hit I just think that fiction writing and reading is a really good place to find Insight because when I think about like Elon and Twitter it's very hard not to get caught up in a lot of the details and a lot of like my biggest concerns about Society what I'm thinking about Peter and Altus it's like oh yeah yeah I get that I know all about that it's very easy to manufacture whatever reasoning you need to do the thing and get the thing that you are hungry for and there's not that many things that people get hungry for it's like food is one of them water air Joy sex meaning love it's a pretty short list so it makes perfect sense for there to be a character who will do literally the opposite of what he has spent his whole public life championing in order to get status because it brings him meaning and he desperately wants that we are very bad like research shows this we are very bad at arguing with ourselves we almost always end up believing what we want to believe and that's a super fun thing to say about other people but it's less comfortable to say about ourselves but it is true of all of us and it's a good thing to look at as we head into a new year with things changing very fast one thing I've learned about me is that I'm very good at becoming whatever an internet platform wants me to be I just had a two go viral on Mastodon I had the top two to the day on Mastodon I got good at YouTube and then Twitter and then Tick Tock and I like spending time in those places they bring me joy they bring me connection they bring me meaning they bring me attention so it's so hard to trust my instincts about whether it's good to spend time I'm in those places and what to do while I'm there because I'm arguing with myself and myself wants to do it so I don't know like should I do what we did for like the first 10 years of this and just like Vibe with what I think is interesting and fly toward the light like a mom or should I be constantly second guessing myself and wondering whether my like pro-social biology is being hacked by algorithms for anti-social aims that are resulting in epidemics of misinformation and disconnection and loneliness I guess John I need to do both which is annoying because it's work it's not just like job work either it's like personal work it's work I have to do on myself to understand my motivations gotta understand my responsibilities that's a no I don't want to I don't want to do that it sucks a little bit to feel conflicted about the things that bring you Joy and how do we make progress unless we talk about problems right like there isn't a way but I do honestly think that there is Damage Done by never being able to see anything without also simultaneously critique like there is critique there there's space for it but you can also love it all of the people I love there is they have space for critique including myself everything has room for improvement but nobody thinks that like room for improvement is synonymous with evil all right what I think I'm trying to get at is that I need to use the internet and internet Platforms in ways where I think I'm more engaging with problems than creating problems more focused on doing work than on deepening conflict but I need to err on the side of being really quite sure if it feels like it might be a little bit good might be a little bit bad I'm arguing with myself and myself as the person who's about to get a lot of attention and notoriety and Status by Tweeting or saying the thing that I'm not sure if it's good or bad are you are you not sure or do you just not want to look too hard at it yeah I thought so John I will see you in 2023 good morning John in 2010 YouTube celebrated itself with a thing called YouTube Rewind at that point this was just a top 10 list of the most popular YouTube videos of the Year something that you could do back in 2010 when a viral video was something that happened maybe once a week and not a hundred times per day like it does now but YouTube Rewind really became itself in 2012 with a video that brought lots of top YouTubers into physical Studios together to be a part of the memes I remember feeling quite left out that I was not a YouTube Rewind that year or the next year so we did manage to slip into what may have been the peak of the series rewind 2014 which is a Vibe even re-watching that though it's clear that there is a problem already a YouTube video was moving away from being a genre of content and toward being a kind of content to illustrate what I mean by that and the shift that really happened between 2016 and 2018 allow me to propose to you a thought experiment Spotify rewind a single video that attempts to encapsulate the entire music Industries year in six minutes no one wants this because it does not make any sense now starting in 2016 Spotify started to do something that people actually liked then and continue to like now rapt is a recap of what you liked not like what happened in music that year what you enjoyed in music and podcasts now on YouTube in 2016 things were simple enough that people were like yeah okay a fair number of these folks are people I have some affinity for or at least familiar with but by 2018 the story of YouTube was very big very complex and had been really quite full of Scandal and more than anything a YouTube video was not a genre of content anymore it was a kind of content it was not a single Community anymore it was many communities and many of those communities disliked each other they had to have known that people would not like it but in the way of large companies I'm sure a lot of people looked at it and they said this is bad but it's the thing that we do and we've done it so let's do it now in response to it being the most disliked YouTube video ever in 2019 they just did like another top 10 video except with more production value and people also disliked that it was clear to me at that point that there would never be a YouTube Rewind and there was not another YouTube Rewind I would like to propose that we bring it back now people are annoyed by Spotify wrapped they will say Spotify rap sucks either because they don't use Spotify and annoys them to feel left out or because they think that like your taste in music doesn't make you an interesting person but I am neither of those kinds of person and I actually think that Spotify raps delivers a ton of value to the people who make content the people who use the platform and the platform itself it seems to be a huge win it shows me who I love which I actually don't know I don't know what YouTuber I watch the most of it gives people content to share if they would like to that's great promotion for Spotify and for the musicians and podcasters who are featured and I think that it gives especially smaller podcasters and musicians a chance to feel appreciated and to connect with their audience I think that this is what YouTube Rewind should be and I think that they should just call it YouTube Rewind I think that that's great a breakdown of my year on YouTube who did I watch who did I like is there a Creator who basically like I'm a bigger fan of them than anyone else because I bet I am I bet I'm gonna like 0.1 percent of a few creators any comments have you left how many videos have you liked how many super thanks and super chats have you sent and in a perfect world there's a chance for me to type a message to my favorite Creator and then the day after YouTube Rewind happens creators get their own rewind that gives them all their stats and a few messages from people who appreciate their content I think Spotify wrapped does good things for the audience the creators and the platforms and I think for the people who find it annoying they're part of the discourse too it's a fun day and it fixes all of YouTube rewinds original problems that it had to pick winners that it had to try and portray YouTube in a particular way that was maybe not consistent with how we were imagining it and of course with YouTube no longer being anything like a unified culture and so YouTube if you're listening put me in coach my Consulting rates are high they consist entirely of donations to Partners in Health John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John I want to tell you about one of the coolest things I've ever found out in my life it really threw me for a loop and I want to throw you for the same Loop so join me on the journey when studying life on our planet it is sometimes useful to think about like how much the living matter of the planet weighs on its own I'm this is enough of this code on its own the idea of living matter is pretty freaking weird right living matter but that's what we are and that matter has mass like I have about 90 000 grams of living matter or do I like not really most of it's water like life couldn't exist without it but it isn't really part of the living system it's kind of just like an ocean that I'm carrying around in a sack with me everywhere I go so that I can do the chemistry that is life what the scientific establishment has decided to do is just count the carbon which makes sense I think that's a good way to do it of course it's not perfectly precise but it's precise enough we call this biomass for example if you look at the biomass of all mammals around a third of it human beings if that seems weird to you it's going to be way weirder than that that's like the least weird thing in the video another third is cows just cows now you might be thinking that leaves the final third for wild mammals I'm sorry no uh further 30 is the rest of the Agricultural animals and four percent four percent of mammal biomass is wild mammals all of the whales and elephants and skunks and armadillos and shrews now is that the weirdest thing in the video no it's not I used to think when I heard this stat that this meant that there used to be a hundred percent wild mammals and now like 96 of them have been replaced by agricultural animals and humans that's not what happened around a hundred thousand years ago humans had a very tentative foothold on the planet pretty insignificant species in terms of biomass and at that point wild mammal biomass was at its peak but had been roughly the same for a very long time it wasn't increasing it wasn't decreasing it was quite stable between 100 000 years ago and ten thousand years ago human biomass changed some but was still pretty insignificant to ten thousand years but wild mammal biomass dropped by like 25 a very big very fast drop we call this the quaternary megafauna Extinction it was an Extinction event of almost entirely very large mammals lots of debate about this definitely a contributor to it uh was human it's very tightly coincided with the arrival of humans in North and South America and then separately in Australia what happens next is the very weird part between 10 000 years ago and 100 years ago agriculture happens like in a big way while the mammal biomass Falls by a further third but the total mammal biomass increases beyond what it ever was purely because of humans and livestock and now in the year 2022 humans by themselves represent three times more biomass than all mammals combined before humans we are heavy in the last hundred thousand years there has been an 85 percent decrease in the wild mammal biomass and an 800 percent increase in the total mammal biomass throughout this video I've been trying to not have any particular judgment about whether the world should be the way that it is just that it's fascinating that it is the way that it is but entering into our conclusion here uh it's bad like it's bad to have an 85 decrease in Wild mammal biomass but it's also very complex like the Earth is absolutely hundred percent at its historical maximum of complicated brains I don't know if y'all caught this but a few days ago some baby was born that was the eight billionth person on the planet I hope they at least got a certificate so I don't really know what to say about this except that obviously we need to be doing all of this quite thoughtfully because this is a very big and fast change and I think that you can make the case that we are actually doing it more thoughtfully now than we were a hundred years ago it's also really great to be able to get coffee and socks delivered to your door once a month and to know that there are people working hard to try and do that as thoughtfully as possible coffee plantations can for example lead to a lot of deforestation but it can also be done in partnership with a forest the small farmers who work with the awesome coffee Club work hard to decrease deforestation and to practice regenerative agriculture the stock club's closing Monday there will not be another VLAN Brothers video between now and then so if you want to sign up you got to do it now the coffee Club will remain open perpetually John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John it's Thursday what am I doing here this is now one of my days I'm making two videos this week because I want to explain something you may have noticed you probably didn't but you might have they were planning on having the awesome socks Club window open for two weeks and now we are into our third week what is that about well we thought that when we launched you would have the ability to switch over from crew socks which are like up to the calf and to ankle socks which starting in January so you could switch over and in January get your first pair of ankle socks and because technology is hard that wasn't the case it's so hard just that one feature has been quite a difficulty it makes me feel like I would never pay a lot of money to acquire a technology company but if we closed it down it would become very hard to switch people over to the ankle socks so we kept it open and now that feature is live and you can go to awesomesocs.club and there's a link and there's also a link down in the description that you can go to if you'd like to switch to ankle socks starting in January you can't do it before then because we won't have ankle socks until January but now that that feature is live it does mean that the stock subscription window will close on Monday the 21st so this is really easier last week for real this time just because there's been a bunch of people who wanted to switch over and haven't been able to I wanted to make a video just like get that message out as far as it could possibly get also really excited about the light roast for the coffee club that launched this week we don't have decaf yet I'm a decaf Drinker we're gonna get there turns out decaf is surprisingly complicated and we want to do it right that's like the whole thing here the idea is that like we're working hard to make sure that the the things we make are like really high quality you get to wear some art on your feet or you get to have like the best coffee that just tastes really good and is good for the world and if we can't do decaf right we're not going to do decaf until we can and when we do I will tell you all all about how decaf is made which is fascinating and why it's so complicated to do it well anyway just want to tell you about the sock thing John you'll see me tomorrow good morning John a few months ago I made a video arguing that Elon Musk misunderstood the challenges of content moderation in social media and that I figured he was quickly discovering as nilai Patel has said that the main product of a social media platform is content moderation whether that's recommendations or algorithmic feeds or demoting and censoring hateful content I think that I was right about that but also that Elon was right about something else that I totally missed and should have seen I am a person who professionally understands a large group of people that's not the whole job but it's a big piece of it like understanding what people will like what they are thinking about what they're concerned about what they're worried about what they're excited about Elon Musk is absolutely right that his people his audience are really worried about something that they call Free Speech this is not what I call free speech and it is not what is protected by the First Amendment but it is a thing and it's a totally legitimate thing here it is internet media platforms have a huge influence on society and there are people who work at those platforms who we do not know know and thus cannot trust who have a huge influence on what is allowed on those platforms and what is promoted and demoted that's real and it's weird and it's worrying because this is a lot of how people communicate now now what Elon Musk said out loud about this was if people want laws preventing speech they'll pass laws preventing speech and until that happens Twitter should just allow all legal speech that's what he said but what he meant was somebody's going to be making these subjective moderation decisions and I don't trust them but I do trust myself and a lot of other people trust me too as I tweeted a few weeks ago a lot of people who say they want free speech actually just want to be the one in charge of which speech is free I thought elon's audience was going to get super mad at him very quickly because it would turn out that he would have to continue making all these subjective content moderation decisions because Twitter still had to be a business that was appealing to users and advertisers I was totally wrong about this Elon Musk doesn't need to change the content moderation policies of Twitter in order to satisfy his audience because this isn't about policy it's about Vibes it's not about the decisions it's about who is making the decisions indeed so far he hasn't changed any policies though I'm not going to put it past it even the ones that he was most upset about before he was in charge and it seems mostly like his audience isn't at all concerned about that so elon's obviously feeling very empowered so is his audience but now we have the opposite problem his people are happy everybody else is either unhappy or at least concerned because remember I just said this it was never about the decisions it was about The Vibes it was about who's making the decisions and a lot of people are not and will never be fans of Elon Musk Twitter's previous management for all of its failures did try to like listen to people who were upset and then make a decision that was thoughtful and transparent but Elon is mostly just gleefully antagonistic towards people who don't agree with that and if those people who've Twitter it just becomes an eight dollar a month subscription to the Elon Musk fan club and that's not a good website however right now the opposite is happening people are flocking to Twitter specifically because of Elon musk's erratic Behavior is the second thing he was right about that I didn't get people don't want Twitter to be stable they want it to be reality TV drama constantly unfolding before them feeling important despite being mostly inconsequential leaning into the interesting has been good for Twitter's growth but I think it's been very bad for Twitter internally and I think it's been bad for advertising dollars and I have no idea whether you can build a sustainable business this way it seems like it would be hard uh and there are a number of challenges that Twitter will need to overcome but what I do know is that while Twitter only occasionally brings me joy the awesome socks Club brings me joy every single month you can get a different pair of socks designed by a different independent artist to deliver to your door once a month free shipping cancel anytime ankle socks or mid-calf Crews now we're shipping out of the EU so you don't have to worry about Customs if you're in Europe I just want to make this as easy a decision as possible the socks are super comfy people will tell you this they're all I wear anymore and 100 of the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John I recently realized that I have an obsession I didn't know about which is not that unusual for me I was just scrolling through my photos like you do and I noticed that in the last few weeks I've taken a lot of pictures of signs so then I just searched Google photos for signs and I found out that I have taken like hundreds of pictures of signs over the last 15 years the earliest one was actually from 2004 so we're we're getting up close to 20. and a lot of them are just objectively very good so I'm going to share with you now my favorites one thing I love about a sign is if it's telling me more than it thinks it's telling me for example this Swan Hunters must have visible means of retrieval sign told me that there are Swan hunters in the world and that sometimes they shoot a swan that they cannot retrieve and that that is a problem that can only really be avoided in one way this sign told me that pit toilets are cleaned by human beings which is something I probably should have known but didn't it also just has a tremendous Kick-Ass aesthetic with all of the scratch graffiti this sign told me that somebody kicked the pony I also really like secret signs like this one I found on the inside door of a mailbox I also like signs that tell me there's a story without telling me what the story is like these three signs that all say do not enter but one of them has been taped over like why why tape over one there is a story here I cannot imagine what it is I love a beautiful sign but I also love a sign that becomes more beautiful like this Railway marker the way that the coding on the sign fractal differently given the different shape of the W and the five same with these two danger signs so great and this rusted up Beast was at that same power station which was behind the lab I worked at in 2004. these were the oldest photos I have of signs possibly this was the beginning of my obsession oh so long ago aging signs is something I really seem to be into I looked at this one for a really long time but I could never figure out what the danger was and then there's the sign marker at the end of a trail in the National Bison Range that I have taken pictures of so many times that I have a catalog of its deterioration I love signs that try to be very clear and succeed like this danger sign I saw in Italy but I also love signs that try too hard to be very clear like this no e-bike sign that has one two three four different indicate caters that it's talking specifically about e-bikes very clearly every person in the meeting had a different idea for how to represent e-bikes and they decided to use all of them but most of all my favorite genre of sign it's clear and looking through them is signs that are accidentally funny but before we get to that I gotta remind you that you are going to need to buy socks throughout your life but instead of that being a chore I want to take care of it for you the awesome socks Club will send you a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist every month we've worked hard to make them cozy and durable and delightful shipping is free you can cancel anytime and all the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone you can sign up for ankle socks or mid-calf cruise and you can get five dollars off your first month with a link in the description you can pause the video right now I will still be here when you get back so what do I mean by unintentionally funny designs well there is a Hall of Fame example here in Missoula Montana this sign which is meant to be two signs but it is impossible to not read it as one certain misspelled signs can be very funny for example this yard sale sign was a huge win for me once I really hit the jackpot when they were reorganizing my grocery store got snack time Eye Care and feminine care breakfast juices and Candy as well as baby care bleach dish soap this one I can't really tell if it was meant to be funny it seemed entirely sincere so I'm including it then there's this giant bronze banana in Palm Springs one of the hottest places in America and it's hot it's a hot banana it's a hot banana it's on the edge of whether this is a sign but these labeled poster boxes from the dftba warehouse which can either be red top to bottom or bottom to top giving very different perspectives on the human story and then I'm gonna end with one of my faves is it my favorite I don't know maybe maybe it is but please don't flash the octopus it's it's in it's at least in the top tier John you can only sign up for the awesome Sox Club this week and next week so you might as well go do it now I'll see you on Tuesday oh look and as a special present this is wild I had 15 extra seconds in this video even though the script was very long so I I don't know what I did I guess I talked really fast but here's some others of my favorites okay five dollars off the awesome socks club with the link in the description good morning John so a couple of months ago I posted a video of me making headquarter fish art for project for awesome donors and there were a bunch of people helping me right here this person is Monica tranelle the reason she's there is that she's running for congress and I wanted to maybe talk to her if I could and so I emailed her and she said let's have coffee and I said let's let's make fish so that was the first time I met Monica trannell but over the last few months I've met her a few more times mostly because I said I would like to rent out some rooms and interview you in them publicly time for some honesty I don't know how to be a person with a big audience who also doesn't like the way that the world is obviously different people have different views on the way that the world should be but I have mine I don't like a lot of the way things are we've had an audience of some kind for a long time I remember celebrating the election of Barack Obama with you like the first one while we were on tour I think we've been doing this for a while but most of what we've done over the years has been pretty nationally focused which makes a lot of sense because our audience is isn't even National it's International so focusing local like very few people here are going to have the opportunity to vote for Monica trannell some of you though and you better because she's great but in general I've started to feel like the Relentless focus on the biggest possible scope of all conversations that always being National isn't good I live in Montana a state that Trump won by 16 in 2020 and by 20 in 2016 but in 2016 we also elected a Democratic governor and we have a Democratic senator John tester who is amazing I don't think anybody would expect that I think most people don't know that because it doesn't fit into the national narrative we are a very red state that does a lot of pretty blue things we can only really tell ourselves simple stories when we don't let a lot of data in now I understand not letting a lot of data and it's very complicated and we want to tell simple stories so that people will believe the thing but these simple stories are starting to Rend Rend so when Joe Biden's team emailed me and they were like do you want to come to the White House to hang out with the president I was like yeah I do but I really only have so much time this year and I'm focusing a lot on what's going on in my community I want to think about that I want to be aware of that I want to know how amazing Monica trannell is and she is amazing and if she doesn't win it's going to be because of a focus on National politics like her opponent isn't very popular but Democrats are unpopular she's put like fifty thousand miles on her minivan traveling across what is one of the largest districts in America talking to people in 16 counties and two tribal Nations and she keeps telling me every chance she gets that she just wishes that I and everybody else could see the America that she sees when she goes out there to listen to people what those conversations are telling her is that people are a lot more complex than they get credit for and that seems wrong to me but her perspective is actually backed up by the research which shows that people see themselves as being pretty 60 40 on stuff but they see their opponents as being very 100 zero on everything in fact there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fit into broader narratives and because it doesn't we just don't ever think about it or talk about it that true fact feels unintuitive to me but it feels intuitive to Monica because she's the one out there doing the work that is why we hire other people to be our leaders because they get to know more about this than we ever will so that we can focus on doing the other thing the problems are very big but this country is messy and it is Led in a lot of different ways and the ballot that I get is a local ballot with local things on it so this election with the time that I had I decided to go local and I feel really good about it John I'll see you on Tuesday and if you can vote in this election you're going to go local too if you aren't sure how to vote where you are or whether you're registered Etc you can check out youtube.com how to vote in every state and I will tell you everything you need to know good morning John one thing we do not talk a lot about here on vlogbrothers is math but I'm about to show you a very low stakes math problem that you don't have to get right that did change the way that I see the social internet when the last vestiges of my timetable still holding on I initially realized that each of the numbers on the right was a multiple of the ones on the left from there I realized that there was a pattern 9 times 10 is 90 8 times 9 is 72 7 times 8 is 56 6 times 7 is 42. great so what is three this math question went viral on Twitter because people were arguing about what three is you may have even been Snappy enough to form an opinion yourself a lot of people said it was 12. a lot of people said it was 18. the 12 people and the 18 people were arguing with each other and they were all very certain that they were right team 18 pointed out that there was a sequence of numbers being multiplied ten nine eight seven and then the next number six would be six times three which would be eighteen twelve said that every number is being multiplied by itself plus one nine times ten six times seven and so three times four is twelve watching people on Twitter argue about this was a little like having sand thrown into my eyes because of course there are two correct answers to this question and neither of them is 12 or 18. the two correct answers are either 12 or 18 not 12 or 18 but 12 or 18. or the second correct answer is the question is wrong but here's the thing to me the right answer is 12. because n times n plus 1 just seems more mathy to me than a sequence being multiplied by the numbers but that's not right in this situation everyone who believes their answer is right is wrong the only people who are right are the ones who know they don't know now with math problems when they are unclear you know that it's a poorly created math problem but with almost every other kind of problem you know that if it is unclear that's actually a pretty good sign that it's a real problem like if it's clear how to solve it it's probably not that big of a problem but I learned something else very interesting from this confounding incorrect math problem which I started to learn when I noticed that people were talking about this rather than every other math problem there's nothing interesting about a math problem everyone agrees on one of the very few reasons that math goes viral is when people fight like this mess of an equation that I see all the time it might seem to a person like me that this would be an important math problem because it comes up a lot but mathematicians don't think this problem is interesting they wouldn't try to answer that question they would ask for it to be Rewritten and so if vague questions that are easy to argue about mislead us into Imagining the world incorrectly I it's important to ask why these questions are easy to argue about and here's why it's not just that people believe different things in this situation it's that it is easy to believe different things looking at this problem it is as easy to know that the answer is 12 as it is to know that the answer is 18. a question like that is bound to get some attention whether it is about math or guns or immigration particularly it will get a lot of questions from people who don't know that much about it because experts are aware that the problem is poorly phrased and badly done and so aren't really interfacing with it but for the rest of us these are situations where it's very easy to have one of several different opinions that are not the same answer questions like that due to the nature of humanity and its algorithms are gonna be the ones we're most likely to see and that's going to drive wedges and not just in the way that we usually think where it's like between two big political parties but also within political parties within communities within people who broadly agree with each other on almost everything they just don't notice because those aren't the interesting things when if the question was asked in a more complete way we wouldn't find it interesting because we'd all agree vague questions that lead to the formation of simple opinions that are likely to conflict with the opinions of others are much more likely to create conflict and thus much more likely to go viral and also very often the answers to those questions are invalid because the questions themselves are wrong John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John the other day I was on Twitter and I noticed a hashtag in the trending tab that I thought was appealing it was appealing to me it said nerd farters and I was like that's very funny I wonder I wonder what that is and honestly I was astounded to find that it was the hashtag of an October nerdfighter art prompt challenge that I did not know existed I found out about it through the trending tab on Twitter which I famously disliked but I suppose the product does deliver some useful information maybe not some maybe just one one piece of useful information which was the existence of the nerdfarters October nerdfighter art prompt challenge so the story is dftba Rachel had the idea ask people if they would be interested and then sweet Carolyn came along and said what if you called it nerd farters people were into it Rachel created this spooky graphic that had a different prompt for each of the 31 days in October we're almost halfway through the month and I wanted to share with you some of the genius that has been created and I hope that more will continue coming the first prompt was simply dftba which people went in a lot of different directions with and since it's the first one I'll go ahead and show you all of them that were submitted I won't do that for any of the other ones the great thing about this is no one is really trying to be a virtuoso except for Alice what the heck Alice now I'm not going to tell you any of my favorites of these but my favorite is obviously the one where I get chased by the crab with a knife our next prompt Pizza John yourself which is unexceptionally good prompt then we had Breezy fall day which is a reference to my second novel thank you for that followed by just the word Pelican on October 4th which is as delightful as you would expect next we have surprise fiddle concert which you could do anything with and then nerdfighteria and then pizzimus and then possibly my favorite prompt of the whole month draw a crab you have to do a bad job it is one thing to be told that you can do a bad job but I think that we need to require ourselves to do a bad job more often otherwise it's just too much pressure and you will never do the thing because you think you're bad at the thing but you can't get better at the thing if you don't do the thing going deeper into the lore here now we have French the llama and puppy-sized elephant then we got million dollar idea featuring surprisingly edible and the awesome club club which look I'm not saying we're gonna do that but I'm not saying that we aren't going to do it either then this Wednesday we had pumpkins and Penguins unsurprisingly full of delightful stuff including an actual pumpkin because it is indeed Halloween and then yesterday The Prompt was hope is the thing with feathers but I filmed this so early yesterday that there weren't any posted yet so if you want to see them you have to go look for the Nerdfighters hashtag on Twitter or follow nerdfarters on Twitter there were of course way too many nerd farts for me to post all of them in this video and it only seems to have been growing organically as the month has gone on and I very much hope that this video will inspire more people to go check it out maybe submit a couple prompts to yourself maybe you have to do a bad job I really love all the prompts I'm personally most looking forward to robot Carl that's exciting for me Superior fish beings is going to be amazing and also of course just I'm very excited to see your lemon man after all these years of doing this and all of the other things that we do I am very happy and excited to not be in control of many of the cool things that happen in this community I think and call me crazy that doing things is never about doing the best thing I think that it is about doing things and ideally doing things with people that you like a lot and who are cool and I am really feeling that energy right now having discovered this organically which is the strangest part like I'd seen a couple of Arts but I hadn't I hadn't like put it together that it was part of a thing until the hashtag just popped up which I guess is why they do the hashtag I just wish it wasn't constantly full of things that make me angry and sad but sometimes it's full of the thing that makes me happy and and what's the opposite of angry I don't know what's the opposite of angry I haven't figured it out let me know if you know what the opposite of angry is John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John in 2014 my social media was suddenly inundated with people telling me about and telling me to talk about solar freaking roadways an Indiegogo campaign that had been published by a company that was making roads that could good news solve every problem because look America is extremely paved there are so many roads and so many parking lots and so many more parking lots than you think there are if we were placed all of the paved area in the U.S with solar panels we would produce more power than the US uses which is a wild statistic that is completely irrelevant the list of reasons why solar roads are a bad idea is very long I will put an incomplete list on the screen right now I'll also put some links in the description but this video is not about why silver roads are a bad idea it's about why so many people thought they were a good idea in medicine or on the podcast sawbones you often hear that cure-alls cured nothing the human body and all the things that can go wrong with it are just too complex for there to be some magical simple solution that solves everything and as I re-watched that 2014 solar freaking roadways video the feeling I get is that the list of problems being solved is just too long they could improve drainage enhance playgrounds alert drivers to upcoming moose fixed the economy eliminate the need for fossil fuel melt snow Dick's power transmission and make partying more fun this is a video built to make people excited about something and since the average person doesn't know very much about how roads work we have people for that it's pretty easy to make a list of problems and then propose a solution that would solve all of them as long as you don't look too hard or know too much what this relies on is people not understanding how complex something that seems simple is and that's fine we're not supposed to nor can we know about everything I think this actually outlines a really important tension in society between like not wanting or being able to have everyone understand the intricacies of how tires interact with different paved surfaces at different levels of moisture and temperatures and speeds and also being frustrated by problems that we see and we see not getting fixed and then of course experts are annoyed when you're like why don't you just fix this problem and you're like well you don't want to know how complicated it is you don't want to know how tires work experts don't want to explain to you why you can't make highways out of glass but the division of expertise is like the number one thing that makes societies work but that stops working when there is no trust and stories of big Simple Solutions once they aren't implemented either rely on you realizing that it's more complicated or thinking that there's some super powerful cabal that's preventing us from doing the simple things which is why a lot of the times conversation about big Simple Solutions interfaces with conspiracy theory solar roadways are a big simple solution and I'm sorry but big Simple Solutions are very rare because everything is very complicated like soap may have been the last big Simple Solution so they do happen but it's been a while but honestly the reason I think this was a moment in a sort of Coney 2012 but two years later kind of way was a good impulse it was hopefulness like that was a hopeful moment we felt like the internet maybe could put an end to a Ugandan warlord or maybe even create a future where roads melted ice warned you about moose and generated more electricity than the cars that ran on them used maybe the problems weren't being solved because there wasn't enough hope or human excitement this was a wild time on the internet we did not know what was possible if only we hadn't found out the solar roadways people are actually still at it they've done some small scale installations and the way I see it it is an incremental value add for a very specific situations which get this is fine it's how almost everything gets done in this big messy complicated world because the big problems aren't there because evil people create them they are there because 8 billion people living together on a single planet is difficult and those big problems only ever really get solved in one situation and that's when lots of people with wildly varying areas of expertise trust each other and work together to solve them John I'll see you tomorrow good morning john so you know how covet 19 is a disease that is caused by sars cov2 which is a virus it feels like it would be better and simpler if we just called that the covid19 virus right so why don't we just do that well in the early 1900s doctors started noticing something weird about some different diseases they would sometimes have patients with shingles a really specific disease where you get a very painful rash on just one side of your body but then later those patients children would often come down with a totally different disease chickenpox which is like lots of different itchy bumps all over the body so they started to think that those two diseases might be caused by the same pathogen and they started to look for evidence of that after a lot of work in the 1950s it was finally confirmed separately in two different ways by two different scientists thomas huckleweller and evelyn nicole so this is one reason why we don't name viruses after the disease they cause indeed it looks like sarco v2 might kind of cause more than one disease there's covid19 and then there's like a blurry line between that and long coven if you want to know more about long covered we did an amazing scishow video about it i'll put a link in the doobly-doo the varicella zoster virus though which causes both shingles and chickenpox is a very clear-cut case children get chickenpox when they are infected by the varicella zoster virus and that happens either through droplets in the air or through exposure to the fluid from the rash or the bumps or more rarely they can get it from exposure to a person with the shingles rash which also contains the virus then almost all of the time quite quickly the child's immune system will fight off the disease and that virus will take refuge in your body for the rest of your life it finds a place to hide and that place is at the base of nerves near your spine and then as you get older your immune system might get weakened by stress or by medication or just by getting older and it will kind of forget about the herpes zoster virus and that will allow it to spring forth and infect the nerve at first that causes like tingling and then itching and then pain as the nerves get inflamed and this is why shingles almost always happens just on one side of the body in a specific area because it's the individual nerve that is having the infection the severity of the pain and discomfort from shingles which i can now personally attest to because i'm getting over a case right now feeling much better but it was very very bad it doesn't hurt anymore it just itches it's one of the reasons why we vaccinate almost all children against chickenpox in the u.s now this means far fewer kids are getting chickenpox and in the future they will be much less likely to get shingles as adults because you don't catch shingles shingles is in effect people might be mad at me for saying this like long chickenpox but other places that aren't the us are not vaccinating kids against chickenpox and the reason why is wild and may include my individual case of shingles in the u.s 95 of adults have had chickenpox which means that they could get shingles but only around one in three of them will but in 1995 we started to vaccinate pretty much every kid against chickenpox and cases of chickenpox among kids of course plummeted and that meant that younger people like me were less likely to be exposed to the virus from sick kids that exposure would be like a kind of natural vaccine that would work best for people in their 30s and 40s those people have fairly good immune systems they're also more likely to be around sick kids that would normally remind our immune systems to keep up the fight without those reminders the immune system is more likely to let the virus already in our bodies start to replicate and shingles slips through those cracks and that's especially the case when combined with immune suppressant medication and stress of which i have both so in effect i may have gotten shingles so that my son doesn't have to shingles rates kind of have to go up before they can go down rates of shingles and young people like me have indeed been on the rise though it doesn't seem to be affecting the rates of shingles in older people where it is more dangerous and that's also helped along by the fact that we now have a very effective shingles vaccine in addition to the separate chickenpox vaccine right now you can only get it if you're over 50 because it's in short supply but my guess is it will be available to younger people eventually this is just another example of how complicated disease and epidemiology and public health are it's just all complicated and hard to figure out and so i'm very grateful to all the people who are working to figure it out right now and to the people who have worked to figure it out in the past including evelyn nicole who was in her twenties when she first isolated the varicella zoster virus and who died of complications from covet 19 in 2020. john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so as you know i run a youtube company that makes educational videos and then gives them away it's not a super great business model but it does work most times the company continues to slowly grow making more things doing more stuff we have around 50 employees now you might find yourself asking how does that work and that's a great question i imagine complexly to be a project of nerdfighteria this is very much where complexly started and so if you are curious i would like to share how we make ends meet in this very new weird world first youtubers make 55 of the money that is made by the ads running on our content youtube also shares 55 of the money they make from youtube premium after their record labels take their cut which if you are curious turns out to be significantly more than an ad supported view but most people aren't signed up for premium so that's around three percent of complexity's revenue while youtube ads are around 28 number two grants a lot of people recognize that our content specifically crash course just generates a whole lot more value than it could ever capture like maybe millions of times more value and some of those people are wealthy or they work for wealthy people or institutions they want people to have access to great resources and so they give us money to make them now grants do sometimes have strings attached some are extra stringy but we always make it very clear that they can give us input and give us ideas but we are in charge of what gets created now this can fluctuate a ton from year to year but last year grants were responsible for about the same amount of revenue as youtube was at 29 coming in at just under 20 is crowdfunding so because people know that basically everything that we do is not sustainable given the current business models of internet content they give us money either through our patreons or through the crash course i think everybody supports things for different reasons but i think there's like a mix of like a selfish thing where like i want this content to exist so i will pay for it and more of a selfless thing which is that like i will pay for this so that all people can have access to it now crowdfunding does not come with any strings at all where advertising or grants could so not only does it make our stuff possible i think it makes it better because we get to make all the choices fourth at fourteen percent of our revenue we also sell our own ads so like policy genius on dear hank and john or curiosity stream on scishow that comes out of our internal sales team it's more of a pain in the butt but the ad rates are higher and we don't have to split it with anybody number five we also license our content to various platforms like it's all available for free but some people want our content like curiosity stream has a lot of crash course on it and we get paid for that altogether all of the licensing last year was about five percent of the company's revenue and last at two percent which is not nothing but it is two percent is physical product just bringing high quality things that provide value into people's lives like the micro cosmos microscope which i'm looking at but you can't see and we'd like to do more stuff like that which is why get this we are selling five calendars for five of our shows the eons and bizarre beasts calendars features the best of the original art created for those shows the micro cosmos calendar features the microphotography of james weiss our master of microscopes and the scishow and scishow space calendars just showcase the variety and beauty of our world and of worlds in our solar system every calendar is printed on high quality people in the us they ship everywhere and they feature not just beautiful images but also lots of interesting facts about those images because we cannot stop ourselves from sharing how cool the world is every show it complexly has a really different mix of how it makes itself sustainable some of our shows don't break even for a pretty long time some of them never do and we end up canceling them and it's hard and it's weird and it often feels like we don't know what we're doing but there's a reason for that which is that no one's done this before like companies like this didn't exist 10 years ago when complexity started we're just very busy trying things out seeing what works just using the talents and skills of people on the team to make things that are great and that we think people will like so how about this i come back next year and i tell you whether or not that two percent changed because maybe you needed a calendar and we made some great ones and they are available at complexitycalendars.com john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i just discovered that the way people used to ask the science side of tumblr questions people very very occasionally ask the science side of twitter questions so i just searched for science side of twitter and i'm going to answer as many questions as they can in four minutes are constellations different in the southern hemisphere like is the big dipper and the zodiac down there the constellations themselves don't change but you can see different ones depending on where you are on earth if you were on the north pole and the earth's axis weren't tilted then you could only ever see just the top half of the constellations and same for the south pole now it's a little complicated because it's tilting so your perspective actually changes a little bit throughout the year but if you're right on the equator as the year goes by you can actually see almost all of the sky though a lot of it will be really close to the horizon so hard to see if you find this confusing it's because it's very confusing the earth is revolving while it's rotating and we're also thinking about us being in different places on a rotating and revolving thing there are some people who get their heads all the way around this but they think about it for a living how do i stop look i don't know i have been told that you need an equal and opposite force i haven't found one yet but i have been assured that they exist what are these giant quasar looking stars though that's just a star that is in our galaxy all those background things in this image those are galaxies that are like billions of miles away so it's literally millions of times closer so it looks a lot brighter and super bright stuff when seen by the james webb space telescope has these diffraction spikes which is caused by the shape of the mirror how many calories on average do you burn taking a massive dump i mean not zero interestingly the anus is a muscle that is almost always contracting um and so it's always burning energy until it is loosened in that case it's burning less energy but i think that that's more than outweighed by a lot of other muscle contractions that are probably going on during the dump plus you know any anxiety you might be experiencing i might also burn a little extra calories why does ketchup have to be refrigerated isn't it primarily vinegar salt and sugar all of which are preservative fascinating question when we talk about preserving foods we're talking about two different things one is preventing bacteria from growing in it which is going to spoil it and make it dangerous high concentrations of vinegar salt and sugar will all prevent bacterial growth but we are also concerned about the complicated molecules in the food stuff breaking down into other molecules that might just taste less good once the ketchup is exposed to a good deal of oxygen those reactions are going to happen more quickly and so we want to slow them down and one way to do that is by having less heat in the system so putting it in the refrigerator hey science twitter any tips for reducing eye strain when using a microscope using a microscope is absolutely a lot of this which is like hunch and eye stream so i suggest you get one of these which the micro cosmos microscope comes with it's a cell phone holder you put the eyepiece in here and then you clamp your cell phone in here and you put it on and you're looking through your microscope like there's a screen now you do have to be able to choose which lens your cell phone is looking through which the iphone doesn't let you do by default there are apps that let you do that though the one i use is called procam and this one is specifically for me how did i get an actual brain freeze without consuming any liquids purely from pouring cold water over my face so a brain freeze is a kind of nerve pain it's your brain misinterpreting a confusing signal getting suddenly cold will cause all the blood vessels near your nerves to contract and then when they warm back up very quickly they will open back up and that will cause a flood of blood to the area that will just be confusing to the nervous system and in your face and head all these sensory nerves are really closely packed together so it's just more common for signals to get confused i think i haven't heard of this happening before but it totally seems like something that could happen does sound travel in outer space sound is just a bunch of molecules slapping into each other so you need a bunch of molecules really densely packed together to carry that signal in an atmosphere we have that this is actually pretty thick soup of molecules right here in space there are basically no molecules so they can't knock into each other to carry sound which is a good thing because the sun is so energetic that if space carried sound as well as our atmosphere it would be a constant 100 decibel roar that we would never not experience what's a good time to wake up my friends because my phone is dying and i need my charger block from their room what you're gonna want to do is get two potatoes and a copper wire and i'm kidding i've just looked at your tweet from 2 27 a.m you don't need to be on twitter anymore bedtime it's bedtime john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John in August of 2019 the New York Times published an article that was titled why hate speech on the Internet is a never-ending problem because this law Shields the law in question was section 230 of the communications decency act later that day they published The Following retraction an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the law that protects hate speech on the internet the First Amendment not section 230 of the communications decency act protects it now this is kind of funny it's also kind of not especially if you know the long history of people misunderstanding section 230 and what it means it is very difficult for all of us to figure out how to adjust to the power that the internet wields and when we're doing that it's pretty easy to look toward what's probably the most important piece of legislation in the history of the internet which was passed as part of a much larger bill when Mark Zuckerberg was 11 years old and then when he was 12 years old almost all of that law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court but they left one section section 230 which says among other things this no provider or user of an interactive Computer Service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider to explain right now I am the other information content provider and YouTube is the provider of the interactive Computer Service and so if I slander someone or try to recruit someone to my terrorist cell or otherwise do something illegal you can sue or find or imprison me you can't hold YouTube liable for what I said this thing section 230 is kind of what made it possible for the many to many internet thing to exist which is good but also bad it's the thing that we love about the internet and it's the thing that we hate about the internet right now the Supreme Court is hearing a case against YouTube that argues that YouTube is not liable for the content in the videos on its platform but it is liable for the recommendations of that content to people if the YouTube algorithm recommends terrorist recruitment videos to YouTube users it isn't just hosting content it's also kind of creating a new kind of content which is the recommendation and that seems a little bit right to me the problem though is where do you draw the line for what counts as a recommendation is a Google search a list of recommendations that Google is making to me does that mean that every internet platform that has a recommendation system of any kind meaning all of them are they liable for what they recommended if they are does the internet work at all it looks like the Supreme Court will not find YouTube liable in this case which I think is good but the reality is that there is something of a difference between the front page of YouTube being algorithmically generated for each individual user and me searching for something and getting recommended results and maybe there's a difference between those two things and chat GPT creating content that I will then read that was nonetheless created by a machine there's definitely a way to see recommendation as creation I just don't think that a law passed in 1996 did a good job of anticipating that and actually I think that that law had a tremendous amount of foresight and has served us fairly well there was a moment when the Supreme Court was talking about this when Justice Kagan said something that I want to play for you now you know every other industry has to internalize the costs of misconduct why is it that the tech industry gets a pass on the other hand I mean we're a court we really don't know about these things you know these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet the implication being we probably shouldn't be trying to figure this stuff out based on 26 words that were written in 1996. it should be decided by passing new legislation that considers the internet as it exists now which is pretty different from when there are interactive Computer Services I think that we're actually pretty dang lucky that section 230 supported the creation of this new tool of many-to-many communication which has I admit drawbacks but I don't think anybody's figured out like a good and simple way to tease all the bad parts out from the good parts and the times that we've attempted to do that haven't had great outcomes it's very hard to legislate for a world that changes this quickly so if it feels sometimes like we don't know how to do this it's because we don't know how to do it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John and welcome to the project for awesome 2023 meme review during the project for awesome people make things and then they submit them to the project for awesome art folder including this music that you're hearing right now from ickle there was a whole album of techno vlogbrother stuff I'm still pretty hyped for awesome and the two cups of black tea that I just had five count them five folders on my desktop that I have filled with stuff relying on the fact that I have two years in a row gotten permission to make extra long videos I'm gonna do that starting of course since it's a meme review with the folder labeled memes just like the project for awesome there is no Rhyme or Reason to this you just start somewhere in the middle and you put the peeps in the bean can and add the Dr Pepper all these powerful white men are are laughing at John Green because they put the Dr Pepper on Peeps and at that point you have to do it I don't know if I've said this before but I actually wrapped like gift wrapped the peeps and it said project for awesome day one open on day one and then my son thought it was a present for him and he opened it at John house and just started eating them sound financial decisions and me being held back by sending two middle-aged guys to a restaurant it's twenty dollars and we are gonna make it worth it everywhere I go I see his face look I'm not necessarily proud I did buy way too many oh geez I just spilled pickle juice on myself it wasn't totally sealed well I do still have my paper towels because it's project for awesome and the most important thing is paper look at how many paper towels I used let's just all take a moment to be grateful for Catherine green anyway I bought too many pickles as all I wanted to say just putting beans in the bean home I've got a bean shirt on and a banana Loca in one hand and a corn dog in the other any cylindrical food is on the table I did buy hot dogs this year and I didn't end up using them next year project for awesome audience just watching me slapping Dr Pepper baked beads on an unsuspecting pickle Hank Green slurping Dr Pepper beans from a banana Loca doesn't exist and can't hurt you oh yeah you think so and I had to get them out somehow I don't know I feel like everyone was having a good time and I stand by the fact that a Twinkie filled with Dr Pepper baked beans is better than a Twinkie knot filled with Dr Pepper baked beans this is in reference to the auction that we had for Ryan Reynolds Deadpool screen worn watch me and Ray were in a tight battle and then Ben came out of the last second Chow this is great because it does look like he's joking but he is not joking Dustin was responsible for the largest single hour of the project for awesome this year support the project for Awesome by watching the live stream by voting on videos by donating by getting married and moving to North Dakota that's a deep cut but that was a fun part of the stream guests are ready signal strong donation steady made a donation to the project already Hank's confetti if you got the confetti perk I've ordered some special stickers to close these up with I'm just waiting on that and then they'll go out to you me before crabilis me after I get a premium subscription to have a crab in my inbox every month I love this because I know the screen cap that this video is from because Oren and I watch it together all the time and we dance Captain Crunch Gotta Love any amount of Darcy that gets into the memes me and John on both crunched a lemon and it was bad both times crunch uh looking at Darcy crunching a carrot instead of me crunching a lemon and look I don't know I feel like I put more into that than Darcy did you can't defeat me humans I know but she can that's right Darcy crunching carrots was responsible for us breaking through the two million dollar barrier this wasn't like the first moments of the project for awesome where I was like I guess it's begun I'm gonna make a hole in the bottom of a peep that's Dr Pepper flavor and filled with beans we didn't have to hit a goal to get there or anything I just couldn't stop myself and I don't know that John liked it for every ten thousand dollars we will reward Darcy with carrots Nerdfighters Max Max Max so his spaceship is very good friendship ended with beans now hummus is my best friend we that was the first mention of hummus of this whole meme review I don't know if anybody was happy to see the banana Loca come back weirdly I now have two because I was gifted one by a friend who didn't know I had one who knew that I would want one so I'm like this in real life I a little bit like the part where you don't like it like you have to know that right I tried to Crunch a carrot as good as Darcy I don't actually think I did I think I did a worse job so the story behind the hummus is that it turns out one of the stock notification sounds in slack is just a woman saying a hummus I changed it because people donated for me to change it and I left it that way for the entire project for rasa but I did mute the more active slack channels and before I did that there was a lot of hummus happening it was a little overwhelmed yeah like this and like that and like that doing 20 on something I need spending twenty dollars so two guys can go to a racks I don't know if you needed that but I think that we all needed that yeah they knew ultimately it is a little hard for it not to be a problem tummy time the project for awesome but we work through it I'm gonna donate for a perk that is so being filled you don't actually get any Bean filled perks that's not that's not available yet maybe next year adding a citrus crunching a almond I don't know if it was supposed to be lemon but it says Ramen and that's great never ask a woman her age a man his salary Hank wear the slip of paper from the balloon win I never found it maybe it's like in one of these cracks or it like flew into the bookshelf somewhere I never found it someday I will we had to vote on who the mascot of the 2023 project for awesome lesson T-Rex clobbered hummus Lemon Lips man was the other option uh it wasn't even close this is great because the meme is referencing itself fantastic work John cannot be quiet about tuberculosis at the moment but God bless him for it John I love you for who you are oh yeah when I crunch the limb and my lips swelled up and I looked like this guy from Monsters Inc also last year I had to pretend to be a crab this year I had to pretend to be a cute little housefly and both times it definitely hurt my knees I did decide that the phone a friend task was too easy so I taped my phone to my phone which also might be part of the reason why my knee hurts this is part of the story of this year's project for awesome we decide like we had to commit the bit we had to make it a priority it's been too long we've talked about racks and not been to a racks we're gonna go to Rex which might be a problem for our pants but we're gonna do it anyway are we gonna talk about why Rax is bad for your pants it's very deep it's too deep it's time to go was I a good restaurant no you ruined pants I don't even really know where it came from this is great because it's destined on the moon and he's Mr T which is tuberculosis racks T-Rex is as well hello the moon you can eat here it's everything it's got everything all at once marked safe from beans on a peeps you're not you're never safe the two Vibes of the project for awesome are a little bit contradictory but I think they come together very well someone accidentally bid 42 000 for the watch and we had to roll it back but luckily we were able to do that stay up to date on your vaccinations the internet's hottest club is the p4a live stream this place has everything Bean filled pickles the word hummus fast food restaurant chain rack honestly that list could have gone on way longer and not gotten any less weird big Lemon Lips a Furby made of beans and dinosaurs going to the Moon if you don't know about Stefan this doesn't make sense but that's okay who would win famous science educator or a puzzle of electric rap the puzzle of the electric rat one I actually found the piece that I couldn't find after the stream ending you think you're gonna get beans no you mostly get slack hummus and beans though baked beans no lemons no lemon baked beans I put a little bit of lemon juice in the Dr Pepper baked beans and it was way it was so good it was way better it needed something to cut that sugar is there a world where I could give Paul Hollywood a pickle stuffed with baked beans because I feel like that would be an achievement Destin kept saying tataria which I understand it looks like tataria now that I'm looking at it to ataria is how it's pronounced I like that spaceship that's a nice spaceship sorry you're memeing the concept of hummus and it was a good mascot maybe just not the best they are both the p4re I cannot disagree Hey look it's the part where I had my phone taped to my foot and I called my friend Joe just drowning in hummus I couldn't make it out who would win one Hank Green or one lemon boy one lemon boy would win oh no was I just whining about my knee the whole time I'm sure I was and that's the end that's the end of the memes everybody time to move on to the next folder none of them are going to be anywhere as long as the memes but we do have one folder that's just called hummus this almost ended up in the art folder because it's beautiful oh my God it's hummus hummus Hank trying to raise money for charity the trains coming by it says Hamas listening for hummus by Hank Green special 16th anniversary edition number one inside joke for nerdfighteria of project for awesome 2023 evocative hummus meme Iraq's being dipped into hummus this person knitted a hummus thing hummus we're hummus because we're hummus and finally a hummus Furby and not the last one you'll see today what's our next folder called you ask it's called T-Rex and it's just rack stuff this is a baby picture of me taking the place of another child who was in a racks commercial deep cut well done Mr

why I have so many tattoos racks you can eat here endless hummus bar this folder is just lemon stuff but there's only four things in it I think I got confused halfway through but here it is this is a lemon crab saying hummus and I think it's crank green so it's also me if only it we're also a dinosaur I didn't feel bad for the lemon before but I do a little bit now you don't have to understand that joke but there it is and finally this it's a crab with lemon lips and my glasses and it's got my press on nails turns out impossible to play guitar with the press on nails on your string fingers and we cap it all off with the last folder on my desktop this one is just labeled art it's just art it's things that were too beautiful for me to It's called The memes including me as a house fly that's a little bit too well done it's kind of freaking me out I'm giant I'm not a cute little fly I'm a big scary fly I'm a big scary flying man I have a lot of little hairs I would love to get into carrot business just so we can make organic Darcy crunch carrots um good be weird do good if that's not the project for awesome I don't know what is for at some point I pretended to be a crab while doing Shakespeare I forgot about that until this moment this is just my very large face with the word beans superimposed over it because this is becoming my brand Eternal salad bar what a beautiful but creepy racks very Twin Peaks Justin going to the Moon in his spaceship car five foot nine brown eyes and a sundress which is just a Deering and John joke it's this that's nothing to do with the project for us I don't know if many people would buy hummus if this was The Branding but I know that I would we have to stop saying now we're cooking with gas we need to stop cooking with gas and it's not even as good as solar powered induction I could definitely see this on a t-shirt but then you'd have to explain it to people hummus somebody made a winter project for awesome cookies there's T-Rex there's crunching there's a bean pickle there's crank green look delicious really lovely we're here because we are here spiral I don't know how you do that that well little darsiered watercolor a little crabulous 2.0 no watercolor a little Lemon Lips watercolor tuberculosis focused Endeavor project for awesome staple with lemon crunch panic attack John Green a rabbit hole crunch it's beautiful we're hummus because we're hummus also a thing that happened a crab with the longest eyelashes you've ever seen and a feather boa and some big old lips beautiful project for awesome mandala again another quite creepy Rex image it's starting to feel kind of threatening with the Eternal salad bar this color pencil T-Rex is so huge he's got a head of hair which you just don't see on dinosaurs very often many of these things seem like they would have taken more than two days to do but I don't know I don't like I don't know how I've never made anything like this I have no idea how hard it is to make but it seems very difficult Lemon Lips no hips that's me Hank Green a bean peep a bunch of dogs pee for a you can cry here it's in the founding documents it's not required but it is encouraged I mean we did the coffee club we did the sock Club what's next this is gorgeous and must have taken a very long time had to be more than just a project for us a project for awesome vision board you just keep cramming stuff in because more weird things are gonna happen this is so cute he's wonderful that's art right I don't like what am I supposed to say T-Rex eating hummus and destroying pants will Darcy carrot very cute Tony orange I couldn't remember Ted lasso's name and I knew that his last name was a noun that's what my brain was telling me okay if you look very closely Mr delicious is inside of this T-Rex he's swearing the nerdfighteria turned 16 this year so it's got a driver's license of course and just so you know it is an organ donor be gay moved to North Dakota self-care is

Pizza Man and I guess Bean boy I don't know what else to oh no don't forget I said it Dustin's given a press conference two just to notice a bunch of dinosaurs I did break an egg over my head I did immediately regret it maybe they were trying to predict that I would write butts on my head but I didn't Sharpie face at all this yes it's a beautiful self-care bunny well I love you card and there's a crank green inside of it down in the bottom of the heart so cute another doodle Board of things going on you are on earth and no one can take that away from you Hank Green's hunky chasa 100 a profit

because we're here p4a2023 dftba crunch I love this triangle in the middle of the rainbow it's really pretty I don't know what to say about this what's up with the giant space dinosaur I don't know it's going to the Moon obviously this is so great I love this it's so adorable dinosaurs in space Gumball Mike of course John Green getting Sharpie faced into from like a sort of Sigmund Freud character here all the way to a very punk rock figure and then there's Hank Green Lemon Lips no hips again this is very good but literally no hips in this situation and I love that p4a logo you made you are a Dino on the moon and no one can take that away from you and green in my new book The anthropubine refilled build can Edition my goodness and then the beans in my pickle by crank Green Oh I think all these were done by the same person so I don't know who it was but thank you it was genius crotch Tony orange again P for a plus I think that's basically the uh the digital download bundle AS p4a Plus and then of course there's this hanger fish crunching a lemon he's lovely and he's made a mistake certainly one of the greatest pieces of project for awesome art this year was these two long Furbies one is a lemon hummus long Furby and the other is a bean pickle long Furby with the crack in it that the beans are coming out of which did happen to my pickle it's not really anything more perfect than that I bought this as a sticker and I'm gonna put it on my laptop because I love my life we're hummus because we're a lemon crab with gigantic lips a lot of people make little compilation images of their whole weekend I love them this was a nice one a nice little Lemon Lips logo I had the Lemon Lips John Green watercolor sketch this little baby meeting it's Mommy strong sad with a crab playing with them you can't explain but it was a nice moment I really feel like it was the road to racks like it's a video game level one we have to fight that giant Dr Pepper peep then we gotta fight the bean pickle then we gotta fight the Lemon Lips and then we gotta fight just a bunch of coffee beans because at one point I did just eat raw coffee beans and then last you gotta fight Tyrannosaurus Rex cause it turns out maybe a lot of the beauty Aesthetics of that time came from thinking that people with consumption were extra hot it froze on John's face when he was making that frowny face he was it was like that for like a full 30 seconds and it was such a perfect meme face it's absolutely beautiful so you could just drink cap that for any any use that you want we're here because we're here but it spells out hummus raising nerdy to the power of awesome be weird do good and it's a T-Rex at the Rex new item Lemon Lips and it's just roaring out hummus and finally the first piece of art I saw and the last one I will show you today is this 3D art of beans stuffed inside of a Dr Pepper pea it was a truly magical project for awesome there were so many ridiculous beautiful memorable moments there was this I'll never forget that it was like I did a magic trick but I none of it was on purpose not even the confetti stuck to the balloon there are a lot of ways to find meaning and purpose in this world but the project for awesome is one that we kind of made up from scratch and it is just ever so good I'm so grateful to all of you who were a part of it in whatever way you were and of course I'm also very grateful to you John we had a really good time it was a good old time and now now I have to figure out how to take all my lights down without getting them all tangled and John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John doing something a little different today it's officially countdown time to project for us I set this video to Premiere so theoretically there are a bunch of people watching all at once right now and they're all in the chat together just chanting butt farting butt Fartman butt Fartman over and over again trying to summon him we'll see if that works if you don't know who butt Fartman is or beanie sandverbs or crank green or Dave the fish or Glenn of the Glenn and Dale of the Dale don't worry that's okay they're all mascots of former projects for awesome not this one what's gonna be the mascot of this project for awesome no one knows you don't know until you start and then immediately I turn into a crab for some reason and this happens which is great no one doesn't like this I didn't even realize we were making mascots for the project for awesome until last year after we had had like over a dozen of them and I don't remember the origin stories they all have origin stories if you're gonna read any of them you should read butt fartman's [Music] excellent well done everyone you can stop chanting now you successfully summoned him now in the chat or in comments if you're late you could just type in the best parts of the project for awesome according to you now you'd think that a 48-hour live stream dedicated to fixing the unfixable problems of humanity and Earth would not be so goofy this is actually something I've noticed quite a bit if you sort of know about the problems and you look at the problems and you say oh that's problem is problem that is somber it's not fun but in the moments when I see people actually working on hard problems ideally together in community with others the recognition of the magnitude of the problem is still there that didn't go away but also it just becomes human community and human Community is all of the things that humans always are whether that is silly or goofy or sad or serious or depressed or anxious or joyful or whatever it's not joyful in spite of the fact that it's directly interfacing with you know some of the greatest challenges that Humanity has to face it's joyful because it isn't like glancing at those things and then being ashamed that they exist it's just accepting that they are and that nothing can ever be perfect but we can work hard and when we work together we can magnify our impact which this year is already building off of over seven hundred thousand dollars in matching grants so if we can raise seven hundred thousand dollars during the project for awesome all of those initial dollars will be matched and we will be at 1.4 million dollars so recognizing the flaws in our world and then witnessing our combined impact yeah it's gonna be a little bit joyful and then you add in the sleep deprivation and you know you get what you get so during the first half of the project for awesome we will again be raising money for Partners in Health and save the children these are two organizations that work to make life better for some of the people who have the very least on our planet and they both do it in ways that build strong foundations for those communities the idea being that those people want to work hard for themselves and their families and their communities they want to help each other out there are things that weigh on those communities lack of Access to Health Care and education not having enough food or clean water we know from evidence from experience that if you give people the resources and a strong foundation on which to build they will build during the second half of the project for awesome the money will go to registered non-profits that are voted on by this community so we divide that up and we split it amongst 20 to 30 non-profits depending on how much we rate people all over have made videos talking about the great work that non-profits that they know about do those videos were submitted to project for awesome.com we'll watch some of them during the live stream but you can also just watch them on the website now and if you like the pitch you could vote on the Charities at project for awesome.com donate you will find a little rewards button you'll click on that and there'll be a lot of rewards you can scroll and scroll and find all the different things that are available and they're very good there's so much and we will talk about all of it at project for awesome.com live which is where you should go the moment this video ends which is right now John I'll see you there good morning John uh there's something about this isn't there Catherine turned to me after finishing your video from this week and she said I was engaged but I was relaxed I think the way we normally do these videos like isn't precisely that I mean I'm not gonna stop doing it this way I like this way this is the way this is the way but I don't think it's relaxing and like I'm getting older maybe the level of energy needs to come down a little bit sometimes a hamstring has to be the most ridiculously named muscle right there can't be a worse one than that Cath is weird like it's just uh somebody looked at that and was like that looks like a small cow but at least kath is like a living animal if it were called a veal string then I'd be like yeah that's equally ridiculous to hamstring that's that's the basic of the situation we're in with hamstring that's got to be the weirdest one I've been working on project for awesome perks because it's uh it's going up quick for the last four or five years we've been making various kinds of spray paint art where we've been using stencils on glass or canvas and when we were doing that we also made something by accident every year I used the same roll of paper as the drop cloth so he wouldn't get paint on whatever surface we were painting on and over the years that paper became really beautiful like it had all the stencil marks and then it had scuffs and Footprints and some of it started to rip and it was just like clear that we weren't going to use this paper again and and I literally like looked down at it in the dumpster and I was like I I can't throw that away I took it home and I cut out squares uh and then I graffiti mopped hangler fish on a bunch of them and they are the hanger fish art this year and they're all signed and numbered there's 250 of them and I'm excited to share them with people and of course it's the only time we're going to be able to do ones like this because that paper doesn't exist anymore it's a pretty good trade though I think and next year I'll have to figure out something else to do I'm not sure if that's not an optimistic or depressing um but I guess that's what figuring out something else to do is both of those things so I have a friend she's a pretty good friend and I go over to her place fairly frequently um and uh and she knows my name which is weird that I mentioned that go over to her place once to to meet a new member of her family she's got a new dog it's extremely cute brand new dog didn't exist a couple months ago and she's like this is Hank meet Hank uh what what am I supposed to do with this like either this is an odd honor that is being bestowed on me or you forgot I existed this isn't a dog that came from the pound with a name this is a new dog that you had an infinite number of names that you could have given I'm not personally a name dogs human names kind of person I my dog was named lemon my cats have been named Cameo and gummy bear we don't run into that problem very often when someone shows up and they're like oh my name's gummy bear too you can do it I just think like avoid the names of people who are going to be at your house a lot and soon sorry it's true if you're watching this um just know that I never said anything and then it just sort of pinged around in there for years until this I forgot about gluteus maximus gluteus maximus is definitely the most ridiculous name for a gluteus maximus like your butt is the emperor of Rome gluteus maximus runs [Music] and [Music] I like to say if it ain't folk don't Blix it it's just funnier John I'll see you tomorrow good morning John surprise it's me I'm here on the channel I thought I was getting a colonoscopy today but it turns out that I'm not you'd think that's something I would know I scheduled one and then I started a new medicine and then they wanted to push it back but then I didn't take it off my schedule so I have one in May it's fine you don't need to know but that means I had a whole extra day which is great because I have a lot to do put on a presentation about titles and thumbnails thinking about redesigning my office I got a couple of updates I need to send out to the community here project for awesome is coming I think I might have like a mild existential crisis about halfway through the day I need to get lunch at some point I might just make a sandwich first the subscriptions system that we use to run the awesome socks club and coffee and also Pizza Miss stuff they had a weird glitch so it may have sent you an email that you're gonna get skipped for this month you won't uh we're working on a fix uh sorry that shouldn't happen again as a man once said still some glitches to work out and I really am grateful because people are so understanding when stuff like this happens so thanks for that I'm so excited about how well those things have done we've got you know thousands of people getting coffee every month and tens of thousands of people getting socks every month it makes me think a lot about what's possible and thinking a lot about what's possible these days often requires me to think about what is impossible which is me doing more stuff which is a shame because I very much love to do more stuff I'm sure that's something no one's ever noticed about me also the project for awesome is approaching rapidly February 17th and video submissions are open we used to do it everybody would upload the video on the same day YouTube doesn't really care about that anymore so you can upload it beforehand get it into our system and then we can review the videos and pick out ones that we might want to feature during the project for awesome live stream so if you want to make your project for awesome video do that and then submit it at project for awesome.com if you don't know what I'm talking about the project for awesome is a yearly 48-hour live stream that John and I and friends have been doing since 2007. we raise money we send people things in exchange for that money both physical and digital things there's a whole campaign that will be live during the live stream during the first half we raise money for save the children and Partners in Health and during the second half we raise money for organizations voted on by the community and we decide that by watching videos that people make talking about the great work that organizations they care about do in their community and in the world so if you want to make a video supporting your favorite charity you can do that it doesn't have to be more than a minute long tell us about the problem that organization is interfacing with why it's a big deal and how they're trying to solve that problem that's that's the basic format of most YouTube videos about anything what is the problem why is it important what should we do about it that's so much of what humans do and it's a good format it's a reason why we do things that way I don't know which of the things that I do is the most important one or even which one I enjoy the most so that's like a weird thing for a bunch of chemical reactions to think I'm also going to be doing the nerdfighteria census fairly soon so if you haven't filled out the survey there's a link in the description to do that so that we can get more data about how people are feeling about nerdfighteria it's good to get a broad base of information from all across this community so that's in the description as well and what else is going on Catherine and I have been having a good old time with delete this lately we kind of fell into a new format called wet or dry where we talk about one wet thing and one dry thing and then try and figure out which of the things is better it sounds like a terrible idea for a podcast but it's maybe my best idea for a podcast ever it's very fun and it's been very silly it maybe is not for kids though just FYI I mostly mentioned that so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening and hydrogen isn't it interesting that there is an element where if you take away the electron it's just a proton it's still hydrogen that's how it works elements are defined by the number of protons they have and hydrogen has one proton so if there's just one proton it's hydrogen that's cool I don't know why it takes me out of the frame a little bit additional thing to share Hank's Channel got one of these so that see that's you right there you see yourself that's you that's what you look like to me it's not how I think of you anyway I have no idea which of the things that I just said is going to fit in this video definitely not all of it that's for sure John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John one thing I think people sense but I don't say that often is that I feel a pretty strong obligation to do good and interesting things with the tools that I have and probably the two most impactful uh things that I have easy access to are one this audience this group of people this community who have supported a lot of very good and interesting things over the years and then the second probably most powerful tool is the people who work at and the things that have been made by complexly all of the things I have been referring to as tools are human beings but yeah I hope you understand what I mean crash course in particular has become a pretty interesting thing in the world of educational media which has resulted in lots of people like knock it on our doors to see if they can invest or partner with us in various ways a lot and to figure out what to do with an asset like that all you really have to do is to sort of understand the entire problem landscape of all of global education so that should be fine but a few years back we did decide to start walking down a road like this and it did start with a lot of trying to figure out what the problems that students in the US in particular face how to imagine those barriers and how to lower them obviously I don't know much about that I'm a YouTuber with a background in Biochemistry so it involved talking to a lot of people who are actually in higher education because we wanted to have a kind of thing that sort of supported people on their Bridge from high school to college in the U.S so for a little bit of context right now at a state school it costs about twelve hundred dollars for a three credit course you can also get credits while you are in high school but sometimes those credits don't transfer indeed lots of these credits don't transfer easily from school to school and figure out when and how they do is a big messy mess and that is just one part of the big messy mess that is the entire education bureaucracy that is more complicated if you have fewer resources and also you probably have less access to information or fewer people who are around you who've been through the system before so as we were doing our research we identified that as actually one of the main barriers that some people just don't know a lot about how this system works and that can result in costly mistakes the other like main big barrier though which is the one that people most often cite when they drop out of school is cost it's just that it costs a lot of money at some point in the last five years some folks at YouTube introduced us to some folks at Arizona State University which is a large public research University with a specific goal of judging itself not by like its rejection rates and how exclusive they are but by how many people they can include in their school so after a lot of conversations and a lot of work from a lot of people we ended up with a thing that's called study hall study hall has like four main parts right now there's fast guides which is like a guide to what different college majors are about what they do for you what people end up doing usually once you get them how to college which is just a crash course on how College Works College foundations which are videos that cover foundational college courses that tons of people have to take and finally a thing that just launched this week at gostudyhall.com which is a way of going from those College foundations course to an actual course that you're taking online that you can get transferable college credit for from Arizona State University the videos are of course still free on YouTube but if you want to take the course you start out by paying 25 once you've signed up and the course Begins the first one begins on March 7th you could take the class with a cohort of students with faculty support and at the end of the course if you think that the course did a good job of teaching you and you like the grade that you got you can pay 400 for a transferable college credit so basically we're providing an option to get foundational course knowledge and transferable credits from a major research institution with more flexibility and at a lower cost and like I kind of can't believe that's real the goal is not to replace college with YouTube videos it's to look closely at the barriers and lower the ones that we can I wish we could fix the whole system with one sweeping action but as long as we can't do that we gotta do what we can with what we have so if you know folks that might be interested in this please tell them about it and of course thank you so much to the dozens of people who have been working on this in one way or another for years now who are at complexly or ASU or at YouTube I'm so proud of the work that we've done and I'm so excited to have it out there John I'll see you on Tuesday not making a video next week instead I'm gonna get a colonoscopy so just so you know that ah my goodness good morning John so I've noticed that for the last few videos you are basically doing just whatever I am doing I did low budget Bo Burnham you did a low budget Bo Burnham I did a Google autofill thing you did a Google autofill thing I think this is cheating or at least lazy and so I am going to make it hard for you by taking you behind the scenes to one of the most advanced aquarium exhibits in the whole world I actually got to tour this exhibit before it actually existed to see the complexity of what makes it all come together because you'd think okay an aquarium on the coast that can't be that complicated pump seawater in put fish in the sea water and it's beautiful well it is more complicated than that than three years ago I actually made a whole video about it and you can watch it but not all ocean is the same in particular it's very different at different depths and there are animals in the deep sea that basically no one gets to see it's extremely hard to go down there it's also hard to get the animals to the surface and once they're at the surface the sea water is so different from the water of the deep sea that they cannot survive in it but at the mount Monterey Bay Aquarium they wanted people to be able to walk amongst the animals of the deep sea just to exist in the same space system and if you go to that exhibit which I have not been able to do yet you can do just that you are in the dark walking through Halls surrounded by animals that typically inhabit the most difficult to visit place on Earth and it is designed to appear to the people walking through the exhibit that that's all fairly effortless it's just something for you to enjoy not for you to understand the engineering behind how it is possible but before the exhibit opened I got to see how that seemingly effortless cohabitation between humans and deep sea animals is actually extremely complicated and fairly precarious so look when I walked into this I thought the hardest part of this process was going to be pressurizing the water to the same pressures as the deep sea because water is very heavy and down at the bottom of the ocean there is a lot of water on top of you enough pressure to very easily kill you but I you know I need to exist at a certain pressure of atmospheric pressure in order to exist and the difference between the ocean pressure at the bottom of the sea and the ocean pressure at the top of the sea is bigger than the difference between air pressure at sea level and space but many deep sea creatures don't have very much gas inside of them so if you bring them up slowly enough they'll be fine so if you don't actually have to pressurize the water what's the concern the trouble is that the sea water itself is different it has higher salinity very consistent low temperature and really consistent gas concentrations that are very different from surface level water and so behind every wall at into the deep there are systems that take water from Monterey Bay and turn it into a simulation of deep sea water and it turns out the hardest part of this is removing the perfect amount of oxygen oxygen is great but it is also a super reactive molecule and these animals are used to an environment with a super low oxygen concentration the oxygen of surface sea level would absolutely kill many of them and so all of the water in this aquarium must be run through a equipment that was designed I'm not kidding for Semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing among other things situations where they really need to control the amount of different chemicals present in a system by running the water over tons of tiny thin membrane straws with very low pressure inside the oxygen basically gets sucked out of the water flowing into the area of lower oxygen but of course they can't take out too much or the animals will asphyxiate it has to be perfectly balanced every hour of every day I cannot go to the deep sea and I probably shouldn't I should leave that to the researchers who are dedicated to understanding and protecting it but the people at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and places like them have worked extremely hard to bring those environments those other worlds within our own to as many of us as they can to inspire wonder and joy and awe at the marvels of our planet and the Curiosity and Ingenuity of the people who inhabit it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John thanks for joining me in our brand new format which I'm sure we will bring back again but today instead of that I'm back in the old space and I'm going to do an old format this one is the one where you ask Google what questions people have been asking by starting to ask it a question and not finish good old Google autocomplete why is there an egg shortage well broadly it is because we build many systems for efficiency rather than resilience if you want to make a lot of eggs really cheap you got to have one very big room with a whole lot of chickens in it but that's also a fantastic circumstance for the transmission of disease like bird flu in order to control diseases Farmers have to kill all of the birds in a facility when one bird gets bird flu and then disinfect the whole place over 60 million birds have been killed in the current bird flu outbreak and that decreases the number of eggs on the market while demand stays roughly the same five dollars for a dozen eggs is a lot of money compared to what we were spending this time last year but a dollar 33 for a dozen eggs which is what we were spending this time last year is a price that some would argue should be a little bit bit higher to allow for more resiliency in that system why is the sky blue the white light that comes from the sun is made of a bunch of different wavelengths that all look different colors to us the gases in our atmosphere are good at scattering blue wavelengths out of the white light so the sun with the blue ticking out looks a little bit yellow while the sky with a blue scattering around looks like blue but as I have said before the sky doesn't exist It's Just an Illusion a kind of one colored rainbow why is my poop green could be a lot of different things uh probably something you ate either it's a bunch of green vegetable stuff or green food coloring or maybe some antibiotics or different medications will turn your poop green if it's accompanied by diarrhea or other symptoms that have been going on for multiple days go see a doctor I'm not a doctor and neither is the internet why is my eye twitching I don't know same though maybe it's because of the this we don't actually know why I was twitched though it's definitely correlated with fatigue and stress and if you don't have one or the other or both of those well done I'm just I'm loving that for you I'm not I'm fine why is the flag at half mass in the U.S and probably other places definitely Canada now that I found this clip when mourning something we often put the flag only halfway up this is sometimes because of like big National tragedies that are in the news but it's also often because of the death of a member of the government or some public servant and it varies from state to state flag Express which sells flags keeps track of this on their website so you can always know if you want to why is my poop black this is significantly more concerning and less common than green poop you should probably go see a doctor immediately it could be because you're bleeding somewhere in your GI tract why is it called Black Friday well At the moment I'm thinking it has something to do with poop but I know that that can't be right so I'll look it up I guess I looked it up and I'm gonna be honest with you it's boring it's like oh there's a lot of traffic on the day after Thanksgiving on the roads people didn't like that why is JJ Watt retiring I don't know man that sounds like a pretty personal question why is these diesel so expensive well it's taxed a little bit higher so that makes it a little bit more expensive also recently we started to require in the US low sulfur diesel because of the human health consequences of having all that sulfur in the air the biggest reason is that when you have a barrel of crude oil the part that can get turned into gasoline is fairly big and it's more flexible that part can be used for a bunch of different stuff that's like high value and low value and you can sort of mix up the market based on what's most needed and most expensive well the part that can get turned into diesel is smaller and the stuff it can get turned into is more valuable than diesel like jet fuel so there's just more higher value demand for the diesel fraction of the crude which drives up the price and our final question in the Google autocomplete list why is my dog shaking and gosh I don't know that that sounds scary I'm sorry about your dog it could be stress anxiety nervousness cold excitement but if this is a new thing and you're worried about it again I'm not a doctor of animals or people so maybe you should go see the vet John after 16 years I still love making videos with you why is this so much fun I don't know but I like it and I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John this is a weird way to make a video I recently fell down while ice skating I didn't fall down actually I dove in front of Oren to make him laugh because I will do anything to see that little kid smile ankle on my hip stayed like in the same place just sort of like right in line with each other but unfortunately my need not occupy any space inside of that line um so that hurts and now I'm squatting this is probably an observation people have made about Los Angeles before but but it's very weird that they're a lot a lot of advertisement tens of millions of dollars of advertisements that are asking me to consider a film or television show for awards Sarah 9921 members of The Academy so each one of those ads is for an audience of less than ten thousand the thing is it must work like they wouldn't do it if it didn't work but how many people that kind of sway so it was really it's not even about the 9921 it's about the like 45 people who might change their votes based on seeing this thing if you could just find those 45 people and give them each a million dollars it would be the same thing all because there's that much economic value I'm now I'm doing stand-up comedy except I'm not I'm just doing stand-up like upset it's a lot of stand-up comedy these days was really just stand up upset I'm gonna do squat down upsettity that's give me loving like I could make a really bad joke uh and everybody'd be like ah but on artificial intelligence makes a really bad joke and everybody loses their minds but this makes sense because if I ask you what like 522 times 8 divided by 64 is no like you don't know if the computer does that not a big deal but if you do that in front of me everybody would lose their minds like I would be like oh like when computers could first do those math problems was it like that were people that freaked out like the way that we were like write a poem about Gilligan's Island in the style of 50 Cent and it didn't like the I would do it like oh wow people felt when calculators were first already I can see this happening where we're like well yeah I mean of course AI can tell you how to hot wire a car as a Shakespearean sonnet but only if you give it like an ethical dilemma as a reason to tell you why to hotwire a car that's no big deal that's what AI does it's been a month we adapt so fast like we're gonna make a living computer sometime in my life it seems like and that's gonna be like amazing huge news on Friday they'll be like we found alien life in a computer we accidentally did that and then on Wednesday it won't even be like new gossip it'll be the same gossip but 40 years from now would be just like Harry Styles and Taylor Swift doing something and I love it and then a year later it'd be like yes this is my friend Steve he's a computer man he's a man-made of computer and he's my friend and that's not weird we this is what we do I found a sticker let me read you what it says it says Samantha Rose Garrison vampire boy available on all streaming platforms [Music] killing our favorite toys little did you know I haven't been before little did you know I could give you a toy of all the best places [Music] good morning John I know that we said maybe we weren't going to do videos this week but hey I found something that I really wanted to share with you and it is this lid to a tea it's a tea lid from a Boba place and it's specifically a tea lid that you can use for Boba so I guess you can do hot Boba and you would put the Boba straw through this part of the teal and then you got your normal sipping hole here this is the hy90m5 if you want to look it up and there's something very odd about this tea lid and I want to know what's going on and I can't figure out the answer and so I'm turning to the power that I have and should not abuse in this way but please someone to help me figure out what's going on if you take a look at the hy90 M5 can we get a focus you will see that it says heat 110 degrees Celsius that to me is very weird on its own but then also notice that the one and the one are different fonts I'm gonna talk through why I think this is so strange for the hy90m5 to say heat one one zero degrees Celsius and have the ones be in two different fonts first of all tea is made out of liquid water and liquid water cannot get hotter than 100 degrees Celsius so you cannot heat tea hotter than 100 degrees Celsius unless you're changing the pressure unless you are putting it in a pressure vessel and putting a bunch of extra air molecules in there you cannot heat to above 100 degrees Celsius you especially cannot do that in Montana where we're way above sea level but that's not part of the conversation the only thing that makes sense that it means to me is that this beverage is hot like you wanted to re-emphasize the part where it says caution hot across the top you wanted to reemphasize that with the heat of the drink in here is 110 degrees Celsius which to an American does not sound very hot so that's a problem but I understand this lid is not necessarily made for an American audience because it's a bobolin and we haven't been on the Boba train for that long and we certainly haven't been on the hot Boba train for very long I have of course looked this up it's a lid from Taiwan where they use celsius so the only thing that makes sense is that they put heat 110 degrees Celsius just to re-emphasize that this is very hot it's hotter than you think it is it's hotter than boiling water even though that is literally impossible unless it contains pure steam so I want to tell you the incorrect thing that I thought about this I thought that it said heat 110 degrees Celsius because originally it said heat 100 degrees Celsius and then somebody decided to take off one of the zeros and add a one just to totally emphasize that this is hotter than boiling water even though that's not possible then it can't it isn't it isn't but they wanted people to be safe so they added an extra 10 degrees Celsius to an already impossible temperature and when they did that they used a different phone they didn't have access to the original document they had to cut and paste to make it look like it said 110 degrees Celsius in fact if you look very close the bottom of this one is a little bit higher than the bottom of this one so it's definitely Photoshop and the only reason to do that is if you want to make get more clear that this is very hot liquid but I wanted to confirm this so I went on the internet and I looked up the hy90 M5 and John it used to say 120 degrees Celsius it used to say 120 degrees Celsius and they changed it to a lower temperature I assume because some patent like me was like there isn't a way that the t is 120 degrees Celsius it would just be steam it would be gaseous water it would explode and so they lowered it to an also impossible temperature like somebody did that making sure that extra work was done so that no one would be happy if anybody has any theories about how this happened that more accurately explains the given circumstances in ways that are less infuriating please let me know John I hope you're having a wonderful New Year's and I'll see you in 2023 good morning John it is likely my last video of 2015. 2020 to 2022. Juicy crust pins get down it's gonna be 2023 John I'm very grateful to you for sharing some thoughts about my books I remember when the second one was coming out I was like talking to Media about it and stuff and people were like what's this about and I'm terrible at that so I said like the first book I kind of wrote to try and like share more clearly what the internet is actually like and this book though the second one is more like what I think it's gonna be like and it is legitimately weird to watch as various parallels hit I just think that fiction writing and reading is a really good place to find Insight because when I think about like Elon and Twitter it's very hard not to get caught up in a lot of the details and a lot of like my biggest concerns about Society what I'm thinking about Peter and Altus it's like oh yeah yeah I get that I know all about that it's very easy to manufacture whatever reasoning you need to do the thing and get the thing that you are hungry for and there's not that many things that people get hungry for it's like food is one of them water air Joy sex meaning love it's a pretty short list so it makes perfect sense for there to be a character who will do literally the opposite of what he has spent his whole public life championing in order to get status because it brings him meaning and he desperately wants that we are very bad like research shows this we are very bad at arguing with ourselves we almost always end up believing what we want to believe and that's a super fun thing to say about other people but it's less comfortable to say about ourselves but it is true of all of us and it's a good thing to look at as we head into a new year with things changing very fast one thing I've learned about me is that I'm very good at becoming whatever an internet platform wants me to be I just had a two go viral on Mastodon I had the top two to the day on Mastodon I got good at YouTube and then Twitter and then Tick Tock and I like spending time in those places they bring me joy they bring me connection they bring me meaning they bring me attention so it's so hard to trust my instincts about whether it's good to spend time I'm in those places and what to do while I'm there because I'm arguing with myself and myself wants to do it so I don't know like should I do what we did for like the first 10 years of this and just like Vibe with what I think is interesting and fly toward the light like a mom or should I be constantly second guessing myself and wondering whether my like pro-social biology is being hacked by algorithms for anti-social aims that are resulting in epidemics of misinformation and disconnection and loneliness I guess John I need to do both which is annoying because it's work it's not just like job work either it's like personal work it's work I have to do on myself to understand my motivations gotta understand my responsibilities that's a no I don't want to I don't want to do that it sucks a little bit to feel conflicted about the things that bring you Joy and how do we make progress unless we talk about problems right like there isn't a way but I do honestly think that there is Damage Done by never being able to see anything without also simultaneously critique like there is critique there there's space for it but you can also love it all of the people I love there is they have space for critique including myself everything has room for improvement but nobody thinks that like room for improvement is synonymous with evil all right what I think I'm trying to get at is that I need to use the internet and internet Platforms in ways where I think I'm more engaging with problems than creating problems more focused on doing work than on deepening conflict but I need to err on the side of being really quite sure if it feels like it might be a little bit good might be a little bit bad I'm arguing with myself and myself as the person who's about to get a lot of attention and notoriety and Status by Tweeting or saying the thing that I'm not sure if it's good or bad are you are you not sure or do you just not want to look too hard at it yeah I thought so John I will see you in 2023 good morning John in 2010 YouTube celebrated itself with a thing called YouTube Rewind at that point this was just a top 10 list of the most popular YouTube videos of the Year something that you could do back in 2010 when a viral video was something that happened maybe once a week and not a hundred times per day like it does now but YouTube Rewind really became itself in 2012 with a video that brought lots of top YouTubers into physical Studios together to be a part of the memes I remember feeling quite left out that I was not a YouTube Rewind that year or the next year so we did manage to slip into what may have been the peak of the series rewind 2014 which is a Vibe even re-watching that though it's clear that there is a problem already a YouTube video was moving away from being a genre of content and toward being a kind of content to illustrate what I mean by that and the shift that really happened between 2016 and 2018 allow me to propose to you a thought experiment Spotify rewind a single video that attempts to encapsulate the entire music Industries year in six minutes no one wants this because it does not make any sense now starting in 2016 Spotify started to do something that people actually liked then and continue to like now rapt is a recap of what you liked not like what happened in music that year what you enjoyed in music and podcasts now on YouTube in 2016 things were simple enough that people were like yeah okay a fair number of these folks are people I have some affinity for or at least familiar with but by 2018 the story of YouTube was very big very complex and had been really quite full of Scandal and more than anything a YouTube video was not a genre of content anymore it was a kind of content it was not a single Community anymore it was many communities and many of those communities disliked each other they had to have known that people would not like it but in the way of large companies I'm sure a lot of people looked at it and they said this is bad but it's the thing that we do and we've done it so let's do it now in response to it being the most disliked YouTube video ever in 2019 they just did like another top 10 video except with more production value and people also disliked that it was clear to me at that point that there would never be a YouTube Rewind and there was not another YouTube Rewind I would like to propose that we bring it back now people are annoyed by Spotify wrapped they will say Spotify rap sucks either because they don't use Spotify and annoys them to feel left out or because they think that like your taste in music doesn't make you an interesting person but I am neither of those kinds of person and I actually think that Spotify raps delivers a ton of value to the people who make content the people who use the platform and the platform itself it seems to be a huge win it shows me who I love which I actually don't know I don't know what YouTuber I watch the most of it gives people content to share if they would like to that's great promotion for Spotify and for the musicians and podcasters who are featured and I think that it gives especially smaller podcasters and musicians a chance to feel appreciated and to connect with their audience I think that this is what YouTube Rewind should be and I think that they should just call it YouTube Rewind I think that that's great a breakdown of my year on YouTube who did I watch who did I like is there a Creator who basically like I'm a bigger fan of them than anyone else because I bet I am I bet I'm gonna like 0.1 percent of a few creators any comments have you left how many videos have you liked how many super thanks and super chats have you sent and in a perfect world there's a chance for me to type a message to my favorite Creator and then the day after YouTube Rewind happens creators get their own rewind that gives them all their stats and a few messages from people who appreciate their content I think Spotify wrapped does good things for the audience the creators and the platforms and I think for the people who find it annoying they're part of the discourse too it's a fun day and it fixes all of YouTube rewinds original problems that it had to pick winners that it had to try and portray YouTube in a particular way that was maybe not consistent with how we were imagining it and of course with YouTube no longer being anything like a unified culture and so YouTube if you're listening put me in coach my Consulting rates are high they consist entirely of donations to Partners in Health John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John I want to tell you about one of the coolest things I've ever found out in my life it really threw me for a loop and I want to throw you for the same Loop so join me on the journey when studying life on our planet it is sometimes useful to think about like how much the living matter of the planet weighs on its own I'm this is enough of this code on its own the idea of living matter is pretty freaking weird right living matter but that's what we are and that matter has mass like I have about 90 000 grams of living matter or do I like not really most of it's water like life couldn't exist without it but it isn't really part of the living system it's kind of just like an ocean that I'm carrying around in a sack with me everywhere I go so that I can do the chemistry that is life what the scientific establishment has decided to do is just count the carbon which makes sense I think that's a good way to do it of course it's not perfectly precise but it's precise enough we call this biomass for example if you look at the biomass of all mammals around a third of it human beings if that seems weird to you it's going to be way weirder than that that's like the least weird thing in the video another third is cows just cows now you might be thinking that leaves the final third for wild mammals I'm sorry no uh further 30 is the rest of the Agricultural animals and four percent four percent of mammal biomass is wild mammals all of the whales and elephants and skunks and armadillos and shrews now is that the weirdest thing in the video no it's not I used to think when I heard this stat that this meant that there used to be a hundred percent wild mammals and now like 96 of them have been replaced by agricultural animals and humans that's not what happened around a hundred thousand years ago humans had a very tentative foothold on the planet pretty insignificant species in terms of biomass and at that point wild mammal biomass was at its peak but had been roughly the same for a very long time it wasn't increasing it wasn't decreasing it was quite stable between 100 000 years ago and ten thousand years ago human biomass changed some but was still pretty insignificant to ten thousand years but wild mammal biomass dropped by like 25 a very big very fast drop we call this the quaternary megafauna Extinction it was an Extinction event of almost entirely very large mammals lots of debate about this definitely a contributor to it uh was human it's very tightly coincided with the arrival of humans in North and South America and then separately in Australia what happens next is the very weird part between 10 000 years ago and 100 years ago agriculture happens like in a big way while the mammal biomass Falls by a further third but the total mammal biomass increases beyond what it ever was purely because of humans and livestock and now in the year 2022 humans by themselves represent three times more biomass than all mammals combined before humans we are heavy in the last hundred thousand years there has been an 85 percent decrease in the wild mammal biomass and an 800 percent increase in the total mammal biomass throughout this video I've been trying to not have any particular judgment about whether the world should be the way that it is just that it's fascinating that it is the way that it is but entering into our conclusion here uh it's bad like it's bad to have an 85 decrease in Wild mammal biomass but it's also very complex like the Earth is absolutely hundred percent at its historical maximum of complicated brains I don't know if y'all caught this but a few days ago some baby was born that was the eight billionth person on the planet I hope they at least got a certificate so I don't really know what to say about this except that obviously we need to be doing all of this quite thoughtfully because this is a very big and fast change and I think that you can make the case that we are actually doing it more thoughtfully now than we were a hundred years ago it's also really great to be able to get coffee and socks delivered to your door once a month and to know that there are people working hard to try and do that as thoughtfully as possible coffee plantations can for example lead to a lot of deforestation but it can also be done in partnership with a forest the small farmers who work with the awesome coffee Club work hard to decrease deforestation and to practice regenerative agriculture the stock club's closing Monday there will not be another VLAN Brothers video between now and then so if you want to sign up you got to do it now the coffee Club will remain open perpetually John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John it's Thursday what am I doing here this is now one of my days I'm making two videos this week because I want to explain something you may have noticed you probably didn't but you might have they were planning on having the awesome socks Club window open for two weeks and now we are into our third week what is that about well we thought that when we launched you would have the ability to switch over from crew socks which are like up to the calf and to ankle socks which starting in January so you could switch over and in January get your first pair of ankle socks and because technology is hard that wasn't the case it's so hard just that one feature has been quite a difficulty it makes me feel like I would never pay a lot of money to acquire a technology company but if we closed it down it would become very hard to switch people over to the ankle socks so we kept it open and now that feature is live and you can go to awesomesocs.club and there's a link and there's also a link down in the description that you can go to if you'd like to switch to ankle socks starting in January you can't do it before then because we won't have ankle socks until January but now that that feature is live it does mean that the stock subscription window will close on Monday the 21st so this is really easier last week for real this time just because there's been a bunch of people who wanted to switch over and haven't been able to I wanted to make a video just like get that message out as far as it could possibly get also really excited about the light roast for the coffee club that launched this week we don't have decaf yet I'm a decaf Drinker we're gonna get there turns out decaf is surprisingly complicated and we want to do it right that's like the whole thing here the idea is that like we're working hard to make sure that the the things we make are like really high quality you get to wear some art on your feet or you get to have like the best coffee that just tastes really good and is good for the world and if we can't do decaf right we're not going to do decaf until we can and when we do I will tell you all all about how decaf is made which is fascinating and why it's so complicated to do it well anyway just want to tell you about the sock thing John you'll see me tomorrow good morning John a few months ago I made a video arguing that Elon Musk misunderstood the challenges of content moderation in social media and that I figured he was quickly discovering as nilai Patel has said that the main product of a social media platform is content moderation whether that's recommendations or algorithmic feeds or demoting and censoring hateful content I think that I was right about that but also that Elon was right about something else that I totally missed and should have seen I am a person who professionally understands a large group of people that's not the whole job but it's a big piece of it like understanding what people will like what they are thinking about what they're concerned about what they're worried about what they're excited about Elon Musk is absolutely right that his people his audience are really worried about something that they call Free Speech this is not what I call free speech and it is not what is protected by the First Amendment but it is a thing and it's a totally legitimate thing here it is internet media platforms have a huge influence on society and there are people who work at those platforms who we do not know know and thus cannot trust who have a huge influence on what is allowed on those platforms and what is promoted and demoted that's real and it's weird and it's worrying because this is a lot of how people communicate now now what Elon Musk said out loud about this was if people want laws preventing speech they'll pass laws preventing speech and until that happens Twitter should just allow all legal speech that's what he said but what he meant was somebody's going to be making these subjective moderation decisions and I don't trust them but I do trust myself and a lot of other people trust me too as I tweeted a few weeks ago a lot of people who say they want free speech actually just want to be the one in charge of which speech is free I thought elon's audience was going to get super mad at him very quickly because it would turn out that he would have to continue making all these subjective content moderation decisions because Twitter still had to be a business that was appealing to users and advertisers I was totally wrong about this Elon Musk doesn't need to change the content moderation policies of Twitter in order to satisfy his audience because this isn't about policy it's about Vibes it's not about the decisions it's about who is making the decisions indeed so far he hasn't changed any policies though I'm not going to put it past it even the ones that he was most upset about before he was in charge and it seems mostly like his audience isn't at all concerned about that so elon's obviously feeling very empowered so is his audience but now we have the opposite problem his people are happy everybody else is either unhappy or at least concerned because remember I just said this it was never about the decisions it was about The Vibes it was about who's making the decisions and a lot of people are not and will never be fans of Elon Musk Twitter's previous management for all of its failures did try to like listen to people who were upset and then make a decision that was thoughtful and transparent but Elon is mostly just gleefully antagonistic towards people who don't agree with that and if those people who've Twitter it just becomes an eight dollar a month subscription to the Elon Musk fan club and that's not a good website however right now the opposite is happening people are flocking to Twitter specifically because of Elon musk's erratic Behavior is the second thing he was right about that I didn't get people don't want Twitter to be stable they want it to be reality TV drama constantly unfolding before them feeling important despite being mostly inconsequential leaning into the interesting has been good for Twitter's growth but I think it's been very bad for Twitter internally and I think it's been bad for advertising dollars and I have no idea whether you can build a sustainable business this way it seems like it would be hard uh and there are a number of challenges that Twitter will need to overcome but what I do know is that while Twitter only occasionally brings me joy the awesome socks Club brings me joy every single month you can get a different pair of socks designed by a different independent artist to deliver to your door once a month free shipping cancel anytime ankle socks or mid-calf Crews now we're shipping out of the EU so you don't have to worry about Customs if you're in Europe I just want to make this as easy a decision as possible the socks are super comfy people will tell you this they're all I wear anymore and 100 of the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John I recently realized that I have an obsession I didn't know about which is not that unusual for me I was just scrolling through my photos like you do and I noticed that in the last few weeks I've taken a lot of pictures of signs so then I just searched Google photos for signs and I found out that I have taken like hundreds of pictures of signs over the last 15 years the earliest one was actually from 2004 so we're we're getting up close to 20. and a lot of them are just objectively very good so I'm going to share with you now my favorites one thing I love about a sign is if it's telling me more than it thinks it's telling me for example this Swan Hunters must have visible means of retrieval sign told me that there are Swan hunters in the world and that sometimes they shoot a swan that they cannot retrieve and that that is a problem that can only really be avoided in one way this sign told me that pit toilets are cleaned by human beings which is something I probably should have known but didn't it also just has a tremendous Kick-Ass aesthetic with all of the scratch graffiti this sign told me that somebody kicked the pony I also really like secret signs like this one I found on the inside door of a mailbox I also like signs that tell me there's a story without telling me what the story is like these three signs that all say do not enter but one of them has been taped over like why why tape over one there is a story here I cannot imagine what it is I love a beautiful sign but I also love a sign that becomes more beautiful like this Railway marker the way that the coding on the sign fractal differently given the different shape of the W and the five same with these two danger signs so great and this rusted up Beast was at that same power station which was behind the lab I worked at in 2004. these were the oldest photos I have of signs possibly this was the beginning of my obsession oh so long ago aging signs is something I really seem to be into I looked at this one for a really long time but I could never figure out what the danger was and then there's the sign marker at the end of a trail in the National Bison Range that I have taken pictures of so many times that I have a catalog of its deterioration I love signs that try to be very clear and succeed like this danger sign I saw in Italy but I also love signs that try too hard to be very clear like this no e-bike sign that has one two three four different indicate caters that it's talking specifically about e-bikes very clearly every person in the meeting had a different idea for how to represent e-bikes and they decided to use all of them but most of all my favorite genre of sign it's clear and looking through them is signs that are accidentally funny but before we get to that I gotta remind you that you are going to need to buy socks throughout your life but instead of that being a chore I want to take care of it for you the awesome socks Club will send you a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist every month we've worked hard to make them cozy and durable and delightful shipping is free you can cancel anytime and all the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone you can sign up for ankle socks or mid-calf cruise and you can get five dollars off your first month with a link in the description you can pause the video right now I will still be here when you get back so what do I mean by unintentionally funny designs well there is a Hall of Fame example here in Missoula Montana this sign which is meant to be two signs but it is impossible to not read it as one certain misspelled signs can be very funny for example this yard sale sign was a huge win for me once I really hit the jackpot when they were reorganizing my grocery store got snack time Eye Care and feminine care breakfast juices and Candy as well as baby care bleach dish soap this one I can't really tell if it was meant to be funny it seemed entirely sincere so I'm including it then there's this giant bronze banana in Palm Springs one of the hottest places in America and it's hot it's a hot banana it's a hot banana it's on the edge of whether this is a sign but these labeled poster boxes from the dftba warehouse which can either be red top to bottom or bottom to top giving very different perspectives on the human story and then I'm gonna end with one of my faves is it my favorite I don't know maybe maybe it is but please don't flash the octopus it's it's in it's at least in the top tier John you can only sign up for the awesome Sox Club this week and next week so you might as well go do it now I'll see you on Tuesday oh look and as a special present this is wild I had 15 extra seconds in this video even though the script was very long so I I don't know what I did I guess I talked really fast but here's some others of my favorites okay five dollars off the awesome socks club with the link in the description good morning John so a couple of months ago I posted a video of me making headquarter fish art for project for awesome donors and there were a bunch of people helping me right here this person is Monica tranelle the reason she's there is that she's running for congress and I wanted to maybe talk to her if I could and so I emailed her and she said let's have coffee and I said let's let's make fish so that was the first time I met Monica trannell but over the last few months I've met her a few more times mostly because I said I would like to rent out some rooms and interview you in them publicly time for some honesty I don't know how to be a person with a big audience who also doesn't like the way that the world is obviously different people have different views on the way that the world should be but I have mine I don't like a lot of the way things are we've had an audience of some kind for a long time I remember celebrating the election of Barack Obama with you like the first one while we were on tour I think we've been doing this for a while but most of what we've done over the years has been pretty nationally focused which makes a lot of sense because our audience is isn't even National it's International so focusing local like very few people here are going to have the opportunity to vote for Monica trannell some of you though and you better because she's great but in general I've started to feel like the Relentless focus on the biggest possible scope of all conversations that always being National isn't good I live in Montana a state that Trump won by 16 in 2020 and by 20 in 2016 but in 2016 we also elected a Democratic governor and we have a Democratic senator John tester who is amazing I don't think anybody would expect that I think most people don't know that because it doesn't fit into the national narrative we are a very red state that does a lot of pretty blue things we can only really tell ourselves simple stories when we don't let a lot of data in now I understand not letting a lot of data and it's very complicated and we want to tell simple stories so that people will believe the thing but these simple stories are starting to Rend Rend so when Joe Biden's team emailed me and they were like do you want to come to the White House to hang out with the president I was like yeah I do but I really only have so much time this year and I'm focusing a lot on what's going on in my community I want to think about that I want to be aware of that I want to know how amazing Monica trannell is and she is amazing and if she doesn't win it's going to be because of a focus on National politics like her opponent isn't very popular but Democrats are unpopular she's put like fifty thousand miles on her minivan traveling across what is one of the largest districts in America talking to people in 16 counties and two tribal Nations and she keeps telling me every chance she gets that she just wishes that I and everybody else could see the America that she sees when she goes out there to listen to people what those conversations are telling her is that people are a lot more complex than they get credit for and that seems wrong to me but her perspective is actually backed up by the research which shows that people see themselves as being pretty 60 40 on stuff but they see their opponents as being very 100 zero on everything in fact there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fit into broader narratives and because it doesn't we just don't ever think about it or talk about it that true fact feels unintuitive to me but it feels intuitive to Monica because she's the one out there doing the work that is why we hire other people to be our leaders because they get to know more about this than we ever will so that we can focus on doing the other thing the problems are very big but this country is messy and it is Led in a lot of different ways and the ballot that I get is a local ballot with local things on it so this election with the time that I had I decided to go local and I feel really good about it John I'll see you on Tuesday and if you can vote in this election you're going to go local too if you aren't sure how to vote where you are or whether you're registered Etc you can check out youtube.com how to vote in every state and I will tell you everything you need to know good morning John one thing we do not talk a lot about here on vlogbrothers is math but I'm about to show you a very low stakes math problem that you don't have to get right that did change the way that I see the social internet when the last vestiges of my timetable still holding on I initially realized that each of the numbers on the right was a multiple of the ones on the left from there I realized that there was a pattern 9 times 10 is 90 8 times 9 is 72 7 times 8 is 56 6 times 7 is 42. great so what is three this math question went viral on Twitter because people were arguing about what three is you may have even been Snappy enough to form an opinion yourself a lot of people said it was 12. a lot of people said it was 18. the 12 people and the 18 people were arguing with each other and they were all very certain that they were right team 18 pointed out that there was a sequence of numbers being multiplied ten nine eight seven and then the next number six would be six times three which would be eighteen twelve said that every number is being multiplied by itself plus one nine times ten six times seven and so three times four is twelve watching people on Twitter argue about this was a little like having sand thrown into my eyes because of course there are two correct answers to this question and neither of them is 12 or 18. the two correct answers are either 12 or 18 not 12 or 18 but 12 or 18. or the second correct answer is the question is wrong but here's the thing to me the right answer is 12. because n times n plus 1 just seems more mathy to me than a sequence being multiplied by the numbers but that's not right in this situation everyone who believes their answer is right is wrong the only people who are right are the ones who know they don't know now with math problems when they are unclear you know that it's a poorly created math problem but with almost every other kind of problem you know that if it is unclear that's actually a pretty good sign that it's a real problem like if it's clear how to solve it it's probably not that big of a problem but I learned something else very interesting from this confounding incorrect math problem which I started to learn when I noticed that people were talking about this rather than every other math problem there's nothing interesting about a math problem everyone agrees on one of the very few reasons that math goes viral is when people fight like this mess of an equation that I see all the time it might seem to a person like me that this would be an important math problem because it comes up a lot but mathematicians don't think this problem is interesting they wouldn't try to answer that question they would ask for it to be Rewritten and so if vague questions that are easy to argue about mislead us into Imagining the world incorrectly I it's important to ask why these questions are easy to argue about and here's why it's not just that people believe different things in this situation it's that it is easy to believe different things looking at this problem it is as easy to know that the answer is 12 as it is to know that the answer is 18. a question like that is bound to get some attention whether it is about math or guns or immigration particularly it will get a lot of questions from people who don't know that much about it because experts are aware that the problem is poorly phrased and badly done and so aren't really interfacing with it but for the rest of us these are situations where it's very easy to have one of several different opinions that are not the same answer questions like that due to the nature of humanity and its algorithms are gonna be the ones we're most likely to see and that's going to drive wedges and not just in the way that we usually think where it's like between two big political parties but also within political parties within communities within people who broadly agree with each other on almost everything they just don't notice because those aren't the interesting things when if the question was asked in a more complete way we wouldn't find it interesting because we'd all agree vague questions that lead to the formation of simple opinions that are likely to conflict with the opinions of others are much more likely to create conflict and thus much more likely to go viral and also very often the answers to those questions are invalid because the questions themselves are wrong John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John the other day I was on Twitter and I noticed a hashtag in the trending tab that I thought was appealing it was appealing to me it said nerd farters and I was like that's very funny I wonder I wonder what that is and honestly I was astounded to find that it was the hashtag of an October nerdfighter art prompt challenge that I did not know existed I found out about it through the trending tab on Twitter which I famously disliked but I suppose the product does deliver some useful information maybe not some maybe just one one piece of useful information which was the existence of the nerdfarters October nerdfighter art prompt challenge so the story is dftba Rachel had the idea ask people if they would be interested and then sweet Carolyn came along and said what if you called it nerd farters people were into it Rachel created this spooky graphic that had a different prompt for each of the 31 days in October we're almost halfway through the month and I wanted to share with you some of the genius that has been created and I hope that more will continue coming the first prompt was simply dftba which people went in a lot of different directions with and since it's the first one I'll go ahead and show you all of them that were submitted I won't do that for any of the other ones the great thing about this is no one is really trying to be a virtuoso except for Alice what the heck Alice now I'm not going to tell you any of my favorites of these but my favorite is obviously the one where I get chased by the crab with a knife our next prompt Pizza John yourself which is unexceptionally good prompt then we had Breezy fall day which is a reference to my second novel thank you for that followed by just the word Pelican on October 4th which is as delightful as you would expect next we have surprise fiddle concert which you could do anything with and then nerdfighteria and then pizzimus and then possibly my favorite prompt of the whole month draw a crab you have to do a bad job it is one thing to be told that you can do a bad job but I think that we need to require ourselves to do a bad job more often otherwise it's just too much pressure and you will never do the thing because you think you're bad at the thing but you can't get better at the thing if you don't do the thing going deeper into the lore here now we have French the llama and puppy-sized elephant then we got million dollar idea featuring surprisingly edible and the awesome club club which look I'm not saying we're gonna do that but I'm not saying that we aren't going to do it either then this Wednesday we had pumpkins and Penguins unsurprisingly full of delightful stuff including an actual pumpkin because it is indeed Halloween and then yesterday The Prompt was hope is the thing with feathers but I filmed this so early yesterday that there weren't any posted yet so if you want to see them you have to go look for the Nerdfighters hashtag on Twitter or follow nerdfarters on Twitter there were of course way too many nerd farts for me to post all of them in this video and it only seems to have been growing organically as the month has gone on and I very much hope that this video will inspire more people to go check it out maybe submit a couple prompts to yourself maybe you have to do a bad job I really love all the prompts I'm personally most looking forward to robot Carl that's exciting for me Superior fish beings is going to be amazing and also of course just I'm very excited to see your lemon man after all these years of doing this and all of the other things that we do I am very happy and excited to not be in control of many of the cool things that happen in this community I think and call me crazy that doing things is never about doing the best thing I think that it is about doing things and ideally doing things with people that you like a lot and who are cool and I am really feeling that energy right now having discovered this organically which is the strangest part like I'd seen a couple of Arts but I hadn't I hadn't like put it together that it was part of a thing until the hashtag just popped up which I guess is why they do the hashtag I just wish it wasn't constantly full of things that make me angry and sad but sometimes it's full of the thing that makes me happy and and what's the opposite of angry I don't know what's the opposite of angry I haven't figured it out let me know if you know what the opposite of angry is John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John in 2014 my social media was suddenly inundated with people telling me about and telling me to talk about solar freaking roadways an Indiegogo campaign that had been published by a company that was making roads that could good news solve every problem because look America is extremely paved there are so many roads and so many parking lots and so many more parking lots than you think there are if we were placed all of the paved area in the U.S with solar panels we would produce more power than the US uses which is a wild statistic that is completely irrelevant the list of reasons why solar roads are a bad idea is very long I will put an incomplete list on the screen right now I'll also put some links in the description but this video is not about why silver roads are a bad idea it's about why so many people thought they were a good idea in medicine or on the podcast sawbones you often hear that cure-alls cured nothing the human body and all the things that can go wrong with it are just too complex for there to be some magical simple solution that solves everything and as I re-watched that 2014 solar freaking roadways video the feeling I get is that the list of problems being solved is just too long they could improve drainage enhance playgrounds alert drivers to upcoming moose fixed the economy eliminate the need for fossil fuel melt snow Dick's power transmission and make partying more fun this is a video built to make people excited about something and since the average person doesn't know very much about how roads work we have people for that it's pretty easy to make a list of problems and then propose a solution that would solve all of them as long as you don't look too hard or know too much what this relies on is people not understanding how complex something that seems simple is and that's fine we're not supposed to nor can we know about everything I think this actually outlines a really important tension in society between like not wanting or being able to have everyone understand the intricacies of how tires interact with different paved surfaces at different levels of moisture and temperatures and speeds and also being frustrated by problems that we see and we see not getting fixed and then of course experts are annoyed when you're like why don't you just fix this problem and you're like well you don't want to know how complicated it is you don't want to know how tires work experts don't want to explain to you why you can't make highways out of glass but the division of expertise is like the number one thing that makes societies work but that stops working when there is no trust and stories of big Simple Solutions once they aren't implemented either rely on you realizing that it's more complicated or thinking that there's some super powerful cabal that's preventing us from doing the simple things which is why a lot of the times conversation about big Simple Solutions interfaces with conspiracy theory solar roadways are a big simple solution and I'm sorry but big Simple Solutions are very rare because everything is very complicated like soap may have been the last big Simple Solution so they do happen but it's been a while but honestly the reason I think this was a moment in a sort of Coney 2012 but two years later kind of way was a good impulse it was hopefulness like that was a hopeful moment we felt like the internet maybe could put an end to a Ugandan warlord or maybe even create a future where roads melted ice warned you about moose and generated more electricity than the cars that ran on them used maybe the problems weren't being solved because there wasn't enough hope or human excitement this was a wild time on the internet we did not know what was possible if only we hadn't found out the solar roadways people are actually still at it they've done some small scale installations and the way I see it it is an incremental value add for a very specific situations which get this is fine it's how almost everything gets done in this big messy complicated world because the big problems aren't there because evil people create them they are there because 8 billion people living together on a single planet is difficult and those big problems only ever really get solved in one situation and that's when lots of people with wildly varying areas of expertise trust each other and work together to solve them John I'll see you tomorrow good morning john so you know how covet 19 is a disease that is caused by sars cov2 which is a virus it feels like it would be better and simpler if we just called that the covid19 virus right so why don't we just do that well in the early 1900s doctors started noticing something weird about some different diseases they would sometimes have patients with shingles a really specific disease where you get a very painful rash on just one side of your body but then later those patients children would often come down with a totally different disease chickenpox which is like lots of different itchy bumps all over the body so they started to think that those two diseases might be caused by the same pathogen and they started to look for evidence of that after a lot of work in the 1950s it was finally confirmed separately in two different ways by two different scientists thomas huckleweller and evelyn nicole so this is one reason why we don't name viruses after the disease they cause indeed it looks like sarco v2 might kind of cause more than one disease there's covid19 and then there's like a blurry line between that and long coven if you want to know more about long covered we did an amazing scishow video about it i'll put a link in the doobly-doo the varicella zoster virus though which causes both shingles and chickenpox is a very clear-cut case children get chickenpox when they are infected by the varicella zoster virus and that happens either through droplets in the air or through exposure to the fluid from the rash or the bumps or more rarely they can get it from exposure to a person with the shingles rash which also contains the virus then almost all of the time quite quickly the child's immune system will fight off the disease and that virus will take refuge in your body for the rest of your life it finds a place to hide and that place is at the base of nerves near your spine and then as you get older your immune system might get weakened by stress or by medication or just by getting older and it will kind of forget about the herpes zoster virus and that will allow it to spring forth and infect the nerve at first that causes like tingling and then itching and then pain as the nerves get inflamed and this is why shingles almost always happens just on one side of the body in a specific area because it's the individual nerve that is having the infection the severity of the pain and discomfort from shingles which i can now personally attest to because i'm getting over a case right now feeling much better but it was very very bad it doesn't hurt anymore it just itches it's one of the reasons why we vaccinate almost all children against chickenpox in the u.s now this means far fewer kids are getting chickenpox and in the future they will be much less likely to get shingles as adults because you don't catch shingles shingles is in effect people might be mad at me for saying this like long chickenpox but other places that aren't the us are not vaccinating kids against chickenpox and the reason why is wild and may include my individual case of shingles in the u.s 95 of adults have had chickenpox which means that they could get shingles but only around one in three of them will but in 1995 we started to vaccinate pretty much every kid against chickenpox and cases of chickenpox among kids of course plummeted and that meant that younger people like me were less likely to be exposed to the virus from sick kids that exposure would be like a kind of natural vaccine that would work best for people in their 30s and 40s those people have fairly good immune systems they're also more likely to be around sick kids that would normally remind our immune systems to keep up the fight without those reminders the immune system is more likely to let the virus already in our bodies start to replicate and shingles slips through those cracks and that's especially the case when combined with immune suppressant medication and stress of which i have both so in effect i may have gotten shingles so that my son doesn't have to shingles rates kind of have to go up before they can go down rates of shingles and young people like me have indeed been on the rise though it doesn't seem to be affecting the rates of shingles in older people where it is more dangerous and that's also helped along by the fact that we now have a very effective shingles vaccine in addition to the separate chickenpox vaccine right now you can only get it if you're over 50 because it's in short supply but my guess is it will be available to younger people eventually this is just another example of how complicated disease and epidemiology and public health are it's just all complicated and hard to figure out and so i'm very grateful to all the people who are working to figure it out right now and to the people who have worked to figure it out in the past including evelyn nicole who was in her twenties when she first isolated the varicella zoster virus and who died of complications from covet 19 in 2020. john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so as you know i run a youtube company that makes educational videos and then gives them away it's not a super great business model but it does work most times the company continues to slowly grow making more things doing more stuff we have around 50 employees now you might find yourself asking how does that work and that's a great question i imagine complexly to be a project of nerdfighteria this is very much where complexly started and so if you are curious i would like to share how we make ends meet in this very new weird world first youtubers make 55 of the money that is made by the ads running on our content youtube also shares 55 of the money they make from youtube premium after their record labels take their cut which if you are curious turns out to be significantly more than an ad supported view but most people aren't signed up for premium so that's around three percent of complexity's revenue while youtube ads are around 28 number two grants a lot of people recognize that our content specifically crash course just generates a whole lot more value than it could ever capture like maybe millions of times more value and some of those people are wealthy or they work for wealthy people or institutions they want people to have access to great resources and so they give us money to make them now grants do sometimes have strings attached some are extra stringy but we always make it very clear that they can give us input and give us ideas but we are in charge of what gets created now this can fluctuate a ton from year to year but last year grants were responsible for about the same amount of revenue as youtube was at 29 coming in at just under 20 is crowdfunding so because people know that basically everything that we do is not sustainable given the current business models of internet content they give us money either through our patreons or through the crash course i think everybody supports things for different reasons but i think there's like a mix of like a selfish thing where like i want this content to exist so i will pay for it and more of a selfless thing which is that like i will pay for this so that all people can have access to it now crowdfunding does not come with any strings at all where advertising or grants could so not only does it make our stuff possible i think it makes it better because we get to make all the choices fourth at fourteen percent of our revenue we also sell our own ads so like policy genius on dear hank and john or curiosity stream on scishow that comes out of our internal sales team it's more of a pain in the butt but the ad rates are higher and we don't have to split it with anybody number five we also license our content to various platforms like it's all available for free but some people want our content like curiosity stream has a lot of crash course on it and we get paid for that altogether all of the licensing last year was about five percent of the company's revenue and last at two percent which is not nothing but it is two percent is physical product just bringing high quality things that provide value into people's lives like the micro cosmos microscope which i'm looking at but you can't see and we'd like to do more stuff like that which is why get this we are selling five calendars for five of our shows the eons and bizarre beasts calendars features the best of the original art created for those shows the micro cosmos calendar features the microphotography of james weiss our master of microscopes and the scishow and scishow space calendars just showcase the variety and beauty of our world and of worlds in our solar system every calendar is printed on high quality people in the us they ship everywhere and they feature not just beautiful images but also lots of interesting facts about those images because we cannot stop ourselves from sharing how cool the world is every show it complexly has a really different mix of how it makes itself sustainable some of our shows don't break even for a pretty long time some of them never do and we end up canceling them and it's hard and it's weird and it often feels like we don't know what we're doing but there's a reason for that which is that no one's done this before like companies like this didn't exist 10 years ago when complexity started we're just very busy trying things out seeing what works just using the talents and skills of people on the team to make things that are great and that we think people will like so how about this i come back next year and i tell you whether or not that two percent changed because maybe you needed a calendar and we made some great ones and they are available at complexitycalendars.com john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i just discovered that the way people used to ask the science side of tumblr questions people very very occasionally ask the science side of twitter questions so i just searched for science side of twitter and i'm going to answer as many questions as they can in four minutes are constellations different in the southern hemisphere like is the big dipper and the zodiac down there the constellations themselves don't change but you can see different ones depending on where you are on earth if you were on the north pole and the earth's axis weren't tilted then you could only ever see just the top half of the constellations and same for the south pole now it's a little complicated because it's tilting so your perspective actually changes a little bit throughout the year but if you're right on the equator as the year goes by you can actually see almost all of the sky though a lot of it will be really close to the horizon so hard to see if you find this confusing it's because it's very confusing the earth is revolving while it's rotating and we're also thinking about us being in different places on a rotating and revolving thing there are some people who get their heads all the way around this but they think about it for a living how do i stop look i don't know i have been told that you need an equal and opposite force i haven't found one yet but i have been assured that they exist what are these giant quasar looking stars though that's just a star that is in our galaxy all those background things in this image those are galaxies that are like billions of miles away so it's literally millions of times closer so it looks a lot brighter and super bright stuff when seen by the james webb space telescope has these diffraction spikes which is caused by the shape of the mirror how many calories on average do you burn taking a massive dump i mean not zero interestingly the anus is a muscle that is almost always contracting um and so it's always burning energy until it is loosened in that case it's burning less energy but i think that that's more than outweighed by a lot of other muscle contractions that are probably going on during the dump plus you know any anxiety you might be experiencing i might also burn a little extra calories why does ketchup have to be refrigerated isn't it primarily vinegar salt and sugar all of which are preservative fascinating question when we talk about preserving foods we're talking about two different things one is preventing bacteria from growing in it which is going to spoil it and make it dangerous high concentrations of vinegar salt and sugar will all prevent bacterial growth but we are also concerned about the complicated molecules in the food stuff breaking down into other molecules that might just taste less good once the ketchup is exposed to a good deal of oxygen those reactions are going to happen more quickly and so we want to slow them down and one way to do that is by having less heat in the system so putting it in the refrigerator hey science twitter any tips for reducing eye strain when using a microscope using a microscope is absolutely a lot of this which is like hunch and eye stream so i suggest you get one of these which the micro cosmos microscope comes with it's a cell phone holder you put the eyepiece in here and then you clamp your cell phone in here and you put it on and you're looking through your microscope like there's a screen now you do have to be able to choose which lens your cell phone is looking through which the iphone doesn't let you do by default there are apps that let you do that though the one i use is called procam and this one is specifically for me how did i get an actual brain freeze without consuming any liquids purely from pouring cold water over my face so a brain freeze is a kind of nerve pain it's your brain misinterpreting a confusing signal getting suddenly cold will cause all the blood vessels near your nerves to contract and then when they warm back up very quickly they will open back up and that will cause a flood of blood to the area that will just be confusing to the nervous system and in your face and head all these sensory nerves are really closely packed together so it's just more common for signals to get confused i think i haven't heard of this happening before but it totally seems like something that could happen does sound travel in outer space sound is just a bunch of molecules slapping into each other so you need a bunch of molecules really densely packed together to carry that signal in an atmosphere we have that this is actually pretty thick soup of molecules right here in space there are basically no molecules so they can't knock into each other to carry sound which is a good thing because the sun is so energetic that if space carried sound as well as our atmosphere it would be a constant 100 decibel roar that we would never not experience what's a good time to wake up my friends because my phone is dying and i need my charger block from their room what you're gonna want to do is get two potatoes and a copper wire and i'm kidding i've just looked at your tweet from 2 27 a.m you don't need to be on twitter anymore bedtime it's bedtime john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John hear me out what if people are almost all pretty good and they're just trying to make things better for themselves and the people they love in a world that has a whole lot of directional inertia what if we're all trying to do that in countries that have tens or hundreds of millions of people who all see the world a little differently from each other what if there are a bunch of leaders who have to try and figure out how to move forward while listening to the wants and needs and hopes and dreams and frustrations and fears of thousands or millions of people and what if this might be a stretch those people are mostly big bags of well-meaning worry trying to do the right thing when it's never clear what the right thing to do is something weird has happened to me in the last couple of weeks and it's the result of I think three different things first is that I finished this book it's called high conflict it talks about how good and important conflict is until it's not anymore until the moment when people start being much more concerned about winning the conflict than solving the problems that spurred the conflict of in the first place how to recognize when that's happening and how to walk back from it if it isn't achieving the goals the second thing that happened is of course last week I spent a huge amount of time trying to understand on a deep level a large piece of legislation and how complicated it is and how important it is and how good it is even though it has parts of it in it that I would rather definitely not be there in doing that I got a better idea of all of the coalitions that had to come together to form some kind of solidarity if not consensus about this then at least buy it you had to take a lot of different kinds of people with some broad alignments about big stuff but a ton of individual disagreement and get them on board for something very complex and big and meaningful the third thing is that a friend of mine died his name was John Engen he was the mayor of my town for the last 15 years long time what I know about him and all of the people I've ever seen work in my city government either elected or Not Elected did is that they have very hard jobs in which they have to listen to a lot of people and then end up doing stuff that makes no one happy because their job isn't to make one group of people happy it's to represent everyone and nothing really hits their desk unless people disagree about it I disagree really really deeply with a lot of people in my community and I'm sure that privately mayor ingen hated when he was hated and there were a lot of people who did not like him as we do with politicians and I'm sure that he was often very frustrated that despite lots of training and his best efforts people still would not hear him sometimes but he understood that the first line on the job description of being a leader was not be heard it was listen for him the first step in being heard was to listen to make sure that people were heard so that they would be more likely to hear him I think leaders all around the world do this and we have no mechanism to celebrate that or to thank them for it it is very very hard and very important work it's been hard to not be be cynical about government for a while now maybe forever but thinking some about the mechanisms for how conflict functions deeply examining some legislation that took a lot of work to build alignment on and of course having caused to examine the life of a really dedicated and talented public servant has put my brain in a different space at least for the moment which has made me feel really good about a thing that we've been doing a really long time called how to vote in every state it's a YouTube channel and also now a tick tock account where you can go and watch the video for your state it'll tell you how to get registered whether you can vote from home how to get a sample ballot how to find your polling place all the stuff you need to make your plan so that you can go and vote because voting as I said on Twitter is the butt wiping of democracy it doesn't solve all the problems and it's not the limit of what you should do but it's pretty low lift and it definitely does not help to not do it so if you or someone you know doesn't have a voting plan for this election check it out or send it to them thank you John feel better I'll see you on Tuesday good morning john today joe biden is probably going to sign the largest single piece of climate change legislation any country on our planet has ever enacted but everything i have read and i have read a lot is frustratingly thin on detail and as i tried to do the research myself on that i i discovered why i've been going over non-partisan analyses congressional budget office reports talking to the people who wrote those reports talking to the administrator of the epa even in some cases reading the actual text of the 700-page bill and what i have found has been a surprise but also a bit of the delight so let's start at the beginning [Music] around 4 billion years ago something started to be alive on earth and ever since then that life has had a profound effect on the planet photosynthesizers used sunlight to break up carbon dioxide to build their bodies out of the carbon and release the oxygen that oxygen made all kinds of interesting weird things happen including at one point killing almost everything so no life creating atmospheric change that has a profound negative impact on life not actually new over time life kept shoving energy into carbon containing molecules and then after the life died those molecules would break down and the energy would be re-released but sometimes the molecules of the dead thing would stay trapped and they wouldn't break down and they would get stuck in the earth where they'd heat up and get squished and become coal or oil or natural gas all that energy emitted by the sun grabbed by life and then stored by the earth waiting there to power your car or your refrigerator or your microsoft zoom that energy is what has powered so much of our modern lives but as we have released that energy to do things with we have also released the original molecules that it was stored inside of those complicated carbon molecules get broken down and carbon dioxide gets released it is a molecule that is opaque to a lot of infrared radiation a gas that makes our atmosphere less clear to heat and so heat that would otherwise escape no longer is there is more energy in the atmosphere and it's changing weather patterns increasing droughts and fires and storms and heat waves but unfortunately we also really need all of that energy to prevent people from dying in heat waves to make the food that people eat to move it around and to power the plane that takes me to visit my brother we can't just turn the power plants off people would start dying very quickly and they wouldn't stop for a really really long time it's messy and it's complex and like those first cyanobacteria people started to wonder if we weren't gonna just ruin it for ourselves but we are smarter than them and we are more capable of passing broad-based industrial policy with a focus on clean energy than they are barely just barely and that brings us up to now [Music] in 2005 a couple of years before this youtube channel began the us hit peak carbon emissions of 7 billion tons per year at the time that problem looked pretty insurmountable this is jesse jenkins one of the world's leading experts on modeling decarbonization efforts talking about those dark years um you know at the time if you could get a wind farm that cost less than a hundred dollars a megawatt hour which is like triple the you know normal electricity rate that was a great deal and solar was 10 times the cost of normal you know power from a gas plant or something but over the last decade you know due to supportive policies in the us but also abroad in you know china and germany and japan and elsewhere we've taken these what we used to call expensive alternative energy technologies that at the time people were worried we couldn't get you know 5 or 10 or 15 percent of our electricity from without blowing up the grid and now there are cheap trillion dollar mainstream you know technologies that are scaling rapidly and are powering you know in the case of some parts of the country the majority of our electricity on certain days i am in what seems to be a weird situation of being more optimistic now than i was 20 years ago because in that time i have seen a lot of change since this youtube channel began we have dropped from 7 billion tons to 5 billion tons emitted per year in the u.s in the next 15 years according to jesse's models which admittedly are trying to predict the future we will probably get down to 3.5 billion tons 50 lower than our peak this week i was able to talk to michael regan the head of the epa and he also talked about this optimism even when i talked to past ep administrators the role technology plays in the solutions that we're seeking the quickness of innovation and the evolution of business models matching with technology and science and data we can move much faster than we've ever moved before we are aiming for net zero carbon emissions in america by 2050 and this is the first time in my life that i have felt like that might be possible we have never undergone a shift in energy use that is anything like this maybe the original electrification of the country but we're gonna have to make this shift a lot faster than we made that shift however complex you think this is it's more complex than that in this case even for experts like we only ever get to see our own little corner of what's going on this is a big problem that no one person understands all of but in this video you're going to go from understanding more than like 80 or 90 of people to understanding this more than 99 of people it's only going to take you like 15 minutes so let's do this what's this okay i like it picasso this bill basically has three big goals and i don't see them being talked about so here's the framework with which to understand this one we are trying to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in the atmosphere two we are trying to make the impacts of climate change and pollution and also this energy shift less impactful on people or ideally a good thing for people so that they like it particularly we would like to decrease the impacts on the most disadvantaged people and third and this is important to understand anything that's going on here this is a bill that is trying to make the united states of america into an industrial center of the clean technology revolution now there are some other smaller things in the build that don't fit into any of these categories we'll talk about them in the future but that's the three big things oh look each one of these blocks is a billion dollars and there are 369 of them and we're going to start filling them up first we want to drive down the cost of installing renewable energy projects that's wind solar and grid scale batteries that's going to lower people's electricity bills and it's also going to make it so that when you plug in your electric car in the year 2027 we'll get to that the power turning your wheels is going to produce less carbon dioxide and wow we have filled up a lot of our billions all this money is here to incentivize power producers to use more wind solar and grid scale batteries that's going to reduce the amount of co2 being released in the atmosphere but also it does the second thing does that by decreasing electricity bills having minimum wage requirements and apprenticeship requirements and it does the third thing by requiring that a lot of the stuff that is going into these projects solar panels batteries wind turbines are made in america and the components are either from america or from our free trade allies if you've ever played tony hawk pro skater you know how like when you do like more than one trick in a row you can get a multiplier it's like that if you do any of these individual things you get some stuff but there's multipliers every time you do more but hank i hear you saying we don't make a lot of solar panels or wind turbines or batteries in america right now how are we going to be able to source those from america don't worry about that boom it's the second biggest thing in the build the manufacturing tax credits not only do the people buying the thing get the tax credit but so the people making the things we're building out a whole industry here 37 billion dollars is expected to go toward helping companies make solar panels and batteries and battery components and wind turbines and etcetera etcetera and they've got to be made in the u.s and they gotta hit those wage and apprenticeship requirements but hank you continue to be concerned solar power and wind power they're intermittent you can't expect them to be on all the time and those batteries they're gonna handle some of that shifting but not all of it that is right we need firm power power that you can turn on whenever you need it and the biggest piece of cash in this bill that goes toward that goes toward existing nuclear power plants helping them stay open and keep operating existing carbon free electricity with tax breaks but only if you meet wage and apprenticeship requirements probably just expect that everything you hear about is going to have wage and apprenticeship requirements because this bill has to be good for people and also there need to be people to work on these things so you need to be training people and you need to be paying them well also focused on firm power are smaller investments in potential future technologies like advanced nuclear power advanced geothermal and advanced biofuels we don't know which of those things is going to be the best or most impactful but all of them could end up being important players in carbon-free firm power all right so now this hypothetical person who's basically constructing the bill with me is concerned that we're giving a lot of money to power plants not a lot of money to people how about 22 billion dollars for you and another 14 billion after that and then 12 billion after that the 22 billion dollars goes to help people upgrade their appliances in their homes like water heaters furnaces stoves and even just their electrical boxes to handle all of that new electricity because guess what you might not have noticed your house currently has an exhaust pipe it is extremely likely that you have power coming into your house in two ways the electricity that powers the lights and the microwave and your microsoft zune and then there's the gas power that powers your furnace and your water heater and maybe your stovetop possibly even your clothes dryer all of that means that your house chugs out co2 and there isn't an easy way to clean that up without replacing those methane burning appliances with appliances that run on electricity if you can't do that not only are you just releasing a lot of carbon dioxide also you're reliant on a single source of fuel for your heat and your hot water and that fuel price can fluctuate a lot while electricity costs don't fluctuate as much and those fluctuations hit low income people extra hard because fuel costs and energy costs are a higher portion of what they spend their money on so this 22 billion goes toward helping people buy and in some cases outright covering the entire cost of appliances that electrify these previously gas-powered things heat pumps to heat and cool homes using electricity heat pump water heaters electric or induction stovetops just buying one of these appliances saves people money in the long term already folks usually can't afford the upfront costs of that especially doing all of these things at the same time well no longer the next 14 billion are to help people and property owners make their buildings more efficient and these last 12 billion are for you guessed it electric vehicle tax credits that you probably can't use i know what you're thinking all that sounded so great until that last part why can i not use my electric vehicle tax credit because of the third thing these cars also have manufacturing requirements and when this bill goes into effect the number of cars that will qualify for that is quite small and they will all be sold very quickly now there were already tax credits on electric vehicles but those credits only apply for the first 200 000 vehicles from each manufacturer and many manufacturers gm tesla etc have already burned through all those this extends those indefinitely for the next 10 years but only if they meet the requirements because again the bill is about all three things other countries have had this kind of industrial policy for decades and that has allowed them to build up their industries producing these things and the people who crafted this bill for better or worse want the u.s to have that kind of industrial policy it now looks like we are more than halfway through the things that this build does but we are not down here things start to get much more dense uh and then you realize that there are actually hundreds of ways that this bill spends money and each one of them does a different thing for different people in different places like hank what about the carbon impact of forest fires yeah that is in there how about decarbonizing airplane fuels yeah early stages in trying to get that done that's in there converting garbage trucks and city buses to electric it definitely does that tax incentives for existing power plants to capture their emissions yeah three billion dollars for that electrifying most of the postal service fleet another three billion for that reconnecting communities that were divided by the interstate highway system yes 3 billion for that too helping farmers figure out systems for sequestering carbon in their fields sure cleaning up and electrifying port infrastructure definitely that early market creation for low carbon building materials also in there new transmission lines because all of this electrification is going to require more robust grid yeah that too charging stations for evs got that as well grants for tribes to invest in clean energy got that too buying debt from rural power co-ops if they promise to shut down their carbon emitting power plants and giving them money to build new infrastructure that's in there too there's a lot of things that are trying to do really specific individual things but there's also big hunks in here that aren't prescriptive it's money for communities to do things that they want to do to decrease their impact here's epa administer michael regan again talking about that a lot of these grant dollars that are in the act we're able to give those to community groups who are partnering with universities and incubation centers the matching dollars and the low interest loans are available to people who have never been at the table if we get these universities and these these these young adults these incubation centers really tackling these issues with community groups on the ground these solutions can look a thousand and one different ways and we have to feed all of these solutions to see which ones work for each individual community we don't have to accept the notion that there's a one size fit all you can look a thousand and one different ways but hank this hypothetical person who was walking me through this entire bill is now asking me why are we doing all of these individual things instead of just doing the one thing if you did one thing it would do everything and that's just to make fossil fuels more expensive gretchen stop trying to make fetch happen it's not going to happen a few years ago an ex-lobbyist from exxonmobil was caught on video saying this nobody is going to to propose a tax on all americans and the cynical side of me says yeah we kind of know that but it gives us a talking point that we can say well what is exxon mobil for well we're for a carbon tax here's the thing we passed this bill staring down the highest inflation rate in decades and five dollar per gallon gas there are two ways to incentivize the move toward clean energy we can make clean energy cheaper and we can make fossil fuels more expensive and with people already having a hard time getting their butts to work nobody in congress was going to keep their jobs if they intentionally made fuel costs go up this bill is very nearly all carrots for clean energy and just a few sticks for fossil fuels but i will talk about those sticks now because one of them i love very much methane is the most simple carbon containing molecule and it is even better at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over the short term it's 80 times better at trapping heat and as we've moved away from coal and toward natural gas which is basically just methane that has been good because methane is a more efficient fuel you get more heat per carbon dioxide molecule that you release except that at every step of the way methane can leak into the atmosphere at the wellhead at the pipeline at the compressor at the infrastructure that delivers it to your house and the facilities that use it the methane emissions reduction program provides incentives to fix leaks and acquire more advanced systems for keeping methane from being released and it also pays for teams to check and see if there are methane leaks and charge increasingly hefty fines to the companies that are releasing this entirely usable potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere those fines go up and up and up until they generate a fairly significant amount of revenue as it forces these companies to clean up their app the other sticks against fossil fuels are fairly minor they reinstate the superfund tax which is basically a big pool of money that polluters pay into and that money is then used to rehabilitate the damage that they do to the environment it is a super fund when i was a kid i thought it was the super fund program it's not that there's also an increase in the percentage of money that the government gets back from oil companies when they take oil and gas off of federal land and finally there's an increase in the cost of holding a lease without developing it so just having it sit there and not using it there's an increase in that cost both of those are basically ways to disincentivize companies from using federal lands to produce oil and gas so there are a couple of things to keep fossil fuels a little more under control but mostly we want their cost to remain steady or even go down as demand for them decreases because the alternatives are just better but also weirdly there's a couple of carrots for fossil fuels [Music] since we are obsessed with anything and everything that makes us feel bad if you've heard anything about this bill you have heard that joe manchin moderate democrat forced the inclusion of a few very weird provisions first and most frustratingly he took a few oil and gas leases in alaska and the gulf of mexico that trump had authorized and then biden had paused and people have been fighting against for years and was like you want my name on this you make those leases happen it's super weird it's super frustrating it's outside of the normal process no one likes this except for of course the oil and gas companies in joe manchin and the other thing was basically a way to prevent any president or lawmakers in the next 10 years from banning fossil fuel leases on federal land and it does this by tying the ability to put clean energy projects on federal land to a requirement to offer leases for oil and gas drilling on other separate federal land now an offered lease is not a sold lease and a sold lease is not an oil well but it is still disappointing kind of gets stuck in your throat even if modelers show that the overall carbon effectiveness of the bill only goes down by about two percent because of these provisions but imagine i guess got what he wanted out of it which is everyone talking more about how he loves fossil fuels and they're his pretty little baby than the entire rest of the bill and also he got to be like one of the title names on the bill despite being one of its biggest opponents so ah so now the right question to ask is is all of this going to work and luckily i have prepared for you more squares each one of these is roughly 5 million fewer tons of co2 and by 2030 there are 200 of them so that's roughly a billion fewer tons of carbon dioxide per year here's where we'll be decreased co2 and transportation saves us 280 million tons per year cleaner power generation saves us 360 million tons cleaner industry saves us 130 million cleaner buildings save us around 70 million tons same for the equivalent carbon dioxide effects of mostly methane but also other greenhouse gases produced by cars like nitric oxides and finally carbon sequestration in agricultural and forest lands gets us a final 80 million tons and of course we do not pause there the effects of these changes are projected to get us down another 500 million tons by 2035. i'm aware that there are going to be people who are going to be mad at me for being pretty unapologetically excited about this bill like i'm mad that we lost the civilian climate corps which would have been thousands of young people working on the ground on these problems i am frustrated that we lost a lot of due process on these oil leases and they weren't even something that i was actively working on so i can't imagine what it must be like for the people who've been fighting those battles look i don't know if it's that i'm old now or that i'm privileged in like a thousand ways or that i've been through a number of climate fights that went very badly maybe i'm just thinking practically about the fact that this might be our last chance to get something substantial done for years like many years maybe especially because there was every likelihood that this could have just not happened like many other parts of the original buildback better didn't happen in fact four measly weeks ago it seemed like it wouldn't happen i got to talk to jesse jenkins about that i was on vacation with my family or leaving for vacation and i got the call from senator schumer's staff that the bill was dead same faces of grief right shock loss anger and some people stopped at anger and they just got mad at joe manchin on the internet and and yelled at you know he got cynical like you were talking about and some of us um including some members of you know a few handful of members of the senate again said no this is not how it's going to end i refuse to accept that so this is also bargaining right that's one of the faces of grief and we went back to work and we bargained and it against all odds it worked i had pretty well given up hope that it was going to succeed at that point given this is the second time the rug was pulled out from under us you know i wanted to be able to tell my kids that we we fought to the very end and it worked um and i am so grateful uh i'm gonna cheer up a little for all the people really that that did that because it was very very close to failure i don't harbor any illusions that i live in a perfect world or a perfect country or that perfect legislation exists there are 330 million of us the fact that we get anything done at all is a little impressive and over the last 10 years we have made tremendous strides in cutting carbon emissions and that has been in large part because of government investment in the us and elsewhere between 2009 and 2017 america spent around 20 billion dollars per year fighting climate change over the next 10 years we will spend 80 billion dollars per year there are a lot of super powerful people who have been working really hard this whole time to slow this down as much as they can at first they say it doesn't exist then they say it's not caused by people then they say it's caused by people but it's not that big of a deal then they say it's that big of a deal but the costs to take it on are too great we have hit them with reality at every step in that process and we're gonna hit them with reality at this step of the process too they will tell us that the costs are too great and after we prove to them that it's not they will tell us that it's too late nothing gets done if you don't believe it can't be done and i for the first time in decades of this have started to believe that it can be done and it's happening i think for two reasons one because of the very hard work of a lot of people from policy to science to communication and outreach and two because it is getting hard to ignore the very real effects of all of this extra energy in our atmosphere and in our oceans we might be in a very narrow window here a moment when the effects are too present for anyone to ignore anymore but not so present that they will hold us back from implementing solutions i don't know how long that window's gonna be open and i was not sure that it was open until somebody did something and said something and they kept working and they kept pushing and they kept making the case that this needed to be done until it got done but now it feels like the window's open it does not feel like we are done one big step does not get you over the mountain pass there is much more to do but as i've been saying i am more optimistic now that this is a challenge that we can actually take on than i have been maybe in my entire career john i'll see you on tuesday heads up my full interviews with jesse jenkins and administrator regan are up over on hank's channel i learned a ton from both of them they're fascinating conversations there's links in the description and also just a general thank you to everyone and there are thousands of you who worked in some way on this bill either advocating or writing or doing policy analysis like it's a big thing both on my behalf but also on behalf of like my son who's going to be around for more of this future and i want his future to be one that i can believe and one where the fair rides that he loves so much are powered by clean energy and you're helping with that so thanks good morning john happy esther day i love you and here's a wonderful thing this is getting easier and i have some ideas about why if i try and look deeply at why it's hard to say i love you to you but easier to say it to mom or catherine or oren first of all the main thing is it's very hard to say why we do or feel anything humans are both very complicated and very simple and the complicated parts make it hard to see the simple parts i'm going to try though the simplest answer here is that saying i love you leaves you very vulnerable it's like saying you have the power to hurt me so so much and like i'm not consciously worried about you hurting me i'm not even really i don't think subconsciously worried about you hurting me but i think i at one point in the past was brothers can have competitive sometimes antagonistic relationships that's certainly been the case in the past for us it's been a long time since our relationship has been traditionally like zero-sum competitive but to some extent it once was and like that's in the foundation right that's down there our relationship is built over time and and there's stuff that is there from the whole time right it's all in there and i think the way that that foundation has continued to affect however it has constructed itself over time has been like you know it's about collaboration it's about earning each other's respect it's about being impressed by each other that's a lot not all of what our relationship has been built on for a long time and i love you doesn't really fit into the shape of that relationship instead of i'm proud of you i really like that thing that you made it's i don't care what you do i love you you are my brother and i will always love you and care about it's a completely different playing field and it's a good playing field it's just not where we have traditionally spent time so it's uncomfortable so with all that out there here's why i think it might be getting easier first we're getting older and accomplishment and competition are just more tempered i think the old playing field seems a little less valuable this new one seems a little more present second maybe you have always been but i am more aware of the fact that all of this is temporary there's just a deeper truer thing than like earning each other's respect through accomplishment and that thing is going to be more and more important in the future and third and god bless her for it esther made us practice those of you who don't know esther earl was a member of our community early on and she died of cancer in 2010 when her friends and family asked how she would like her birthday to be celebrated after she was gone she said she wanted it to be like a time to celebrate non-romantic love like a valentine's day but for all the other kinds of love pretty much the best answer she possibly could have given the first time you do anything new it's gonna be hard and oftentimes if it's out of your typical experience it's hard the fifth time but now it's been like 12 times and that is a gift that's a good gift a couple of yesterday updates tonight at eight pm eastern time there's going to be a live stream that will feature uh some people from this star won't go out esther's family and john and sarah and the animal wonders folks and there's also this beautiful t-shirt designed by karen hallion all the proceeds from that go to this star won't go out which is a charity that helps families with sick kids john i love you i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so probably you have heard that for a long time the amount of energy entering the earth's atmosphere and the amount leaving the earth's atmosphere was about the same and that was good because if those two numbers are not equal then we're either getting colder every year or we're getting hotter every year but now it looks like there is in fact more energy coming in than going out and that results in basically three things first more heat which is what we call like individual molecules moving faster which is wild like when you are hot it is because the molecules that make up your body are jiggling more doesn't seem real but it is second you have more severe weather which is when a lot of molecules together move around more and because of those two you have number three which is probably the worst of them things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that when that stuff changes crops might have dramatically lower yields resulting in very hungry people people might use their air conditioners way more than in the past so entire power grids fail or forests that grew in areas that once had shorter dry seasons might burn up in fires so that's bad and always the first thing you should ask when something bad is happening is why is that happening well you know when you go outside wearing a black t-shirt you get hotter faster than if you're wearing a white t-shirt that's because things only look black if they absorb all of the visible light that is hitting them if the light was not being absorbed it would either be reflected as white light or as a mirror or it would be clear which would be a strange choice for a shirt so if you're wearing a white shirt the visible light isn't being absorbed it's being reflected and that's why you're less hot absorb reflect or let pass through that's basically the only three things that a material can do with light and if the light is being absorbed that means the energy of the light hit the molecule in such a way that it's creating movement in the molecule the light no longer exists the energy is now movement and that movement can be transferred to other molecules just like a cue ball hitting a pool ball there are basically two ways a molecule can heat up and we just talked about both of them the first is that a photon travels through space and then gets absorbed by a molecule and speeds up that molecule that's heat from radiation and the second way is that a particle that's jiggling a lot hits a particle that's jiggling less and transfers its heat to that other molecule when that happens in a solid we call it conduction when it happens in a fluid we call it convection so like when you're in the shade 99 of the heat you are feeling is from convection it's molecules in the air running into you and transferring their heat to you but when you're in the sun it's a mix of both the radiation and the convection which is why it's hotter in the sun now different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light like this book cover is mostly absorbing everything but yellow and this one is mostly absorbing everything but red and the red and the yellow are being reflected back and this can also happen with gases there can be green gases and yellow gases and brown gases but the two molecules of interest here carbon dioxide and methane they don't absorb any light in the visible spectrum which means that they are clear we can't see them one of the problems with methane actually if your house is filling up with it you need to make sure that you know that that's happening but you can't see it but at certain infrared wavelengths which the sun creates a lot of they are black and when we put more of them in the atmosphere our atmosphere is a little less clear in those wavelengths and it's a little more black those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise cooler denser air rushes in to take its place and that's weather now those hot air molecules might remove more moisture from the soil resulting in more wildfires they might evaporate more water from the ocean resulting in bigger storms we know that this happens we know how this happens we know why this happens and we know what the effects are and we know that the only way to stop it is for there to be less co2 and methane in the atmosphere but that is a very hard thing to do it's very hard and expensive to remove those things from the atmosphere it's very hard and very expensive to replace the agriculture and energy and transportation infrastructure that results in the release of those gases it is not an easy problem to solve but we have a very strong grip on what the problem is and i think people can solve basically any problem if only we can agree that it exists john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so probably you have heard that for a long

on what the problem is and i think people can solve basically any problem if only we can agree that it exists john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John we just got the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope and a lot of people it seems are feeling a bit small right now maybe humbled maybe insignificant but here's something weird I'm actually not sure if I feel very small right now or very big so when you look at a structure like the cosmic Cliffs with seven light year tall Peaks or a Deep Field image that you cannot put your pinky finger on without covering several galaxies it makes sense to think okay so why do we think that anything that happens here on Earth matters at all and there are really good human answers to that question answer is like we give our universe meaning we matter to each other but there are also maybe some like kind of objective answers would we understand that an area in the sky the size of a grain of sand contains thousands of galaxies that each contain billions of stars and we say I feel insignificant now that is not a way of saying nothing matters it's an instinct that something matters but that that mattering is spread throughout what appears to be a basically infinite universe and so we don't matter something matters just not us because we are too small to matter but I wonder is size the right measure I've got a kind of okay understanding of how the universe works like not great but maybe a bit better than average and one thing that seems to be basically the case is that there are a bunch of practically infinite fields that cause particles to exist and interact in a number of ways and as evidenced by the presence of oxygen and hydrogen Spectra in galaxies billions of light years away the rules appear to be consistent throughout the whole universe now this is all very complicated but it's also not it's just physics doing physics things but while the universe is astoundingly Big indeed very possibly infinite in size it's not that big in time now you might say Hank actually 13.7 billion years seemed like a very long time like practically infinite but no the universe is Young compared to both infinity and compared to its eventual lifespan life on Earth is one continual chemical system that dates back 3.7 billion years which means that this wild Frolic that includes everything from Brachiosaurus to BTS has existed for 27 of the lifetime of the universe we do not take up much space but we have taken up a lot of time so that's one way we are bigger than we might think but here's another the vast majority of the particles in the universe do not know they exist they have never wanted something they've never looked at something and found it beautiful they have never built a space telescope and when I say like vast majority I mean that the number of particles that are part of any system with wants and Sensations is so small that they may as well be ignored but we can agree they should not be ignored because they are very strange and very different and very beautiful and they know things about themselves and about each other in your head you have around the same number of neurons as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy and those neurons are much smaller than stars but they are in fact more ordered and you could argue that each one is more complex if you think galaxies are amazing just wait until you find out about you now are we the only chemical system to have built a space telescope no the way I understand the universe that is an impossibility but it also does not seem very common for the universe to find paths toward waking up and to be a part of that it feels very big John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John so probably in part because I take a medicine to control an autoimmune disease I got a special kind of covid that goes away and then it comes back again it's a bit of a struggle that has me looking for for the bright side of things and I did finally lose my sense of smell slash taste and and you don't actually lose your your taste you got your sour Bitter Sweet salty Umami you keep those but you lose all of the complexity of the nose you get five tastes but yet like tens of thousands of smell it's amazing and for whatever reason it stopped working in me and this has made me curious because I like most foods but there are some foods that I literally just taste like poison to me and I wonder if without the smell component of taste which is a big part of taste will I still dislike that things that I dislike tend to be vinegary and vinegar is very sour so my guess is that if I eat something vinegary I'm gonna still hate it but you never know ah I have never enjoyed a pickle so let's see what happens that's very bad there's a lot of bitterness I'm sitting here though and now I kind of want more of it oh no I also like all rational people don't understand why people have black licorice so let's crack that open as well it sounds really delicious right on the label so that's a big hunk okay oh absolutely fantastic I hate black licorice this is great they're just sweet of course they're sweet and then there's like a nice mix of a bitter sour that's doing a great job of complementing the sweetness wow that's great oh my gosh it's really delicious if my sense of smell never comes back I will take everybody's black licorice everything that's good all right I'm also not a fan of blue cheese so in order to make sure I'm doing the Lord's work here let's get a big like way more than I would ever eat this even of a normal cheese oh that's good shockingly sweet very salty wow that's good whoa whoa blue cheese is great when you can't smell I would never have thought that it would be sweet I might eat all of that I'm gonna get some crackers I guess is that I'm still not gonna like anchovies just how I didn't like pickles because they're basically just pickles but fish instead of cucumbers but you never know three two one oh God ah there's no water in here oh my God I'm a spit machine right now oh uh that's clearly an ingredient it's not a thing you eat on its own in that package of anchovies there's 74 of your daily salt so that's not that's not a good food all right now for the Moment of Truth uh there's a lot left in my bag here but all of it is olives we're gonna start off with black olives I don't know which olives are more Olive who knows maybe they're good without smell this is an olive well it's not vinegary at all it's just salty that's good that's what an olive tasted like I would eat all this salty it's got a little little bit of something like a like a richness maybe it's just fatty like a fatty flavor that's quite nice and then the salt is a little much that's a good that was a good experience I figured I was gonna hate that honestly and to finish this off I believe designed specifically for people who do not have a sense of taste it's blue cheese stuffed green olives I'm gonna make a prediction I'm gonna say these are gonna be too salty why do I keep smelling things anyway ah very salty but the cheese brings a lot of like sweetness and sourness to it and that's great that's great that's good it's a good texture the cheese is a really nice texture to it there is something there now I feel like I'm getting in my in my smell Zone there's not Olive flavor it's like a rich nutty feeling that's delish if you like the flavor of Olives olives would be great but unfortunately for me when I can actually taste them they taste like poison John thanks for hanging out as I search for some bright side and it is this I got to eat olives without hating them and black licorice too that was my favorite part because honestly not a lot of bright sides to this almost as if covid really sucks obviously feeling a little bit better now but main thing from my experience rest lay down no pressure convalesce and that's what I've mostly been doing John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning john i have not left this room in about a week like i have not gone out that door which is you know not great luckily it is a child suite which means that i have there's quite a long walk i can do just from one one end of the room to the other i did actually spend a little bit of time in the top bunk just to alleviate borden i also spent some time over here it's a nice little spot at first i was honestly like oh this ain't so bad i'm gonna get a lot of stuff done it turns out no i have cover and that's meant not a lot of motivation and a lot of sleep i'm doing covered tests i'm doing one right now and it's also meant a lot of watching i have a giant tv look at this giant tv it's huge and i can connect it to my phone i can watch anything that my phone can do so the last like five and a half years since oren was born i think i've seen six movies parasite knives out little women coco and kanto and into the spider verse and i decided i'd just go ahead and double that in a matter of days and so since i have nothing better to do here's seven movie reviews in four minutes i started out with dune and i was pretty fevery at this point so i'm not sure if she should take my opinion super seriously i've also watched a lot of dune content over the years i sort of had the thought while i was watching it why like it felt a lot like all of the other dune things i've consumed if the answer to why is because movies look better now they're prettier than yes okay i accept it looks very good the vibes are very strong i'm definitely gonna watch the next one i cried one time during this movie second we watched shang chi which i really loved i was really in it i did start to think that maybe i'm a little bit over superhero movies and their ability to turn every single plot point into a fight or chase scene i know that that's the whole point of a superhero movie so like it's not on shanghai but i cried two times during this movie one was because of katie the other was because of a dragon third suggested by sam reich was derek delgadio's in and of itself which was the best thing maybe i've ever seen this a live audience one man show kept my attention better than shang chi and its thousand intricately choreographed fight scenes i did not look away from the screen for a moment it was definitely the best 90 minutes i have spent in this hotel room i cried maybe 300 times and saying that that was my favorite thing was something because of number four everything everywhere all at once which i have heard lots about and for the first like 30 minutes maybe i was like yeah yeah this is what i was expecting they didn't just make a cerebral sci-fi kung fu thriller and they didn't just make it hilarious and absurd they also made it all about the only thing that matters which is people loving each other and those rocks the rocks john i was so worried that they were gonna do this thing to me but they didn't do the thing to me and then they went and got that raccoon accurate count of number of cries gotta be in the double digits number five uh lighthouse i get why people suggested that i watch it but i will remind you i'm trapped in a hotel room really good movie at letting you know what it feels like to be insane my subconscious did put me to sleep during it like i had to pause and go back a while because i fell asleep which worries me like what what about that did you find relaxing i did not cry during this movie number six detective pikachu which i watched directly after lighthouse for some reason but in a weird way not knowing very much about pokemon a similar kind of fever dream frankly i was delighted i was not surprised by all but one of the plot twists the guy who does the voice of pikachu a plus great and i cried zero times but it almost got me it really did and our final film was palm springs which i did not know about until craig benzene told me about it i think a lot of people might hear like the synopsis of this one and be like well i've already seen groundhog day and no very different but you know also funny and touching and extremely clever a lot of conversations we're bound to be having right now i liked it a lot and i cried one time john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john you are not eating a credit card's worth of microplastics a week now you might not have been worried about that but a lot of people are and that makes sense because a lot of very credible news organizations have run stories saying that you are eating a credit card's worth of microplastics every week the fact that this definitely untrue statement was spread in so many legitimate news organizations has been quite annoying to me but it's also been something of a curiosity to me like these places do fact check they don't just publish whatever comes across their desk itself knowing that it is almost always better to lean into curiosity than frustration i did that and what i found is remarkable this was an 11 step process step one the world wildlife fund is worried about plastics and they should be there are too many way too many single-use plastics and we need to stop this so step two the wwf commissioned a study from the university of newcastle to do a literature review basically look at a bunch of different studies that measured how plastics might enter people and then add all of those sources up every study that they reviewed had a different range they added all those ranges up and they came to their own range of 0.1 grams to 5 grams of plastic ingested every week and this isn't useful data to the average person it's just too imprecise it's like saying that the average person eats between one pound and 50 pounds of food per day the wwf then did a normal thing they used the study they commissioned to create a talking point people could be consuming five grams of microplastics per week this is not a lie but it's kind of a misrepresentation it's kind of misleading all this happened in 2019 and none of it reached very far because headlines that said you could be eating a credit card of plastic per week is like well i could be eating a thousand spiders per night tell me when you're sure no one wrote that people definitely were eating a credit card's worth of plastic per week until 2022 why step number four scientists at the medical university of vienna were among those who were misled they took the upper bound of the estimate the five grams and used it as just a background stat in the introduction to their pain when they did that they removed the context of the lower bound they didn't say 0.1 grams 25 grams they just said five grams it didn't have anything to do with their methodology or what they were studying it was just a background stat and that's not really what people paid the most attention to when they're doing peer review so step six peer review didn't catch it step number seven that publication then got run through the university pr team which is tasked with presenting research in ways that might be interesting to the average person and to the press and unsurprisingly the very first sentence in that press release was five grams of plastic particles on average entered the human gastrointestinal tract per person per week because indeed if that were true it would be a very interesting statistic so you're going to put it at the beginning of your press release so now we have a press release of a peer-reviewed paper that says that people on average eat a credit card's worth of plastic every week step number eight less than a week later gut news.com had found that press release and published a headline containing the claim step number nine that article spread fast enough that the very next day the new york post published an article with the claim in the headlines step number 10 legitimate news outlets saw the new york post article and they were like well we can't just publish that because the new york post lies for a living but we will do a fact check and they did and they found a peer-reviewed paper that contained the claim peer-reviewed article plus a really great headline that's going to be good enough for them step number 11 it was a really good headline so lots of people clicked on it and lots of people shared it meaning it wasn't just published it spread when i first saw this headline i was super lucky because it was in the new york post and i know to be skeptical of the new york post but if you saw it first at usa today or abc news or nautilus all totally legitimate news organizations and if you're like primed by this world to believe that everything is as bad as could possibly be i totally understand not being skeptical of that headline it is kind of wild to me how many steps and how many mistakes were made along the way in order for this false fact to get published in mainstream news outlets every person in their own way is trying to make sense of the world and we would like the sense that we make of the world to be based on reality even though we've built up many systems for doing that as individuals and as a society our own very normal biases and the realities of what it takes to capture people's attention these days makes sense-making a monster of a challenge john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i think a medicine that increases my chances of getting skin cancer so every year i have to go see a dermatologist to check and make sure that all my skin cells are acting all nice and respectful and none of them are stepping out of line and trying to kill me so far this has always gone fine that one time they did take a biopsy of a thing in my foot only to discover that it was pieces of a pinecone that i stepped on when i was in high school at my most recent dermatology visit there was a med student in the room doing one of the 20 000 things you have to do in order to become a doctor you wrap it all up they leave i put my clothes back on i walk outside and she says i just want to thank you so much for crash course and that feels so good every single time even if they just saw my butt and this happens frequently yesterday i was at the coffee shop with oren because it's his first day of summer vacation two people thank me for crash course one of them is starting nursing school this week john when we started crash course i certainly hoped that it would be successful in helping students learn and i couldn't have told you that it would be successful and i much less could have told you why it would be successful but now i do understand that and i want to explain it to you we started crash courses youtubers which i didn't think about at the time but it turns out that really mattered because when you're on youtube you have to compete in a very specific environment and there's two ways you can beat one you have to grab and hold on to people's attention and second you have to do it inexpensively because on youtube you make like 10 to 100 times less per minute of content you produce than on television now to make educational content hold onto people's attention you just have to make it really good you have to be conveying a lot of information to people keep their attention keep them from looking at the sidebar and getting distracted to do it inexpensively you have to basically take out everything that isn't doing that and that is what created crash courses laser focus on what we talk about all the time now which is lowering barriers to education and there are from where i set two major barriers to learning one is access can you afford it is it available where you are were you accepted into the program etc but second and often ignored is the actual barrier of learning the world is complex and you need well-trained experts to get complicated ideas into other people's heads if it were easy people wouldn't be taking out tens of thousands of dollars of student loans to get it done crash course lowers that barrier as much as it can by being as good as it can be by finding the stories to tell the ways to contextualize the information in ways that matter to students by emulating some of the style of the content that they are already familiar with an appreciation that first barrier the barrier to access we solve that by not just being free but by being available to everyone who has an internet connection and a strong understanding of the english language but we have done of course in arabic and we're working on a biology course in spanish right crash course is on youtube because it is where people are it is where students are and teachers and learners because everybody's on youtube they spend time there they feel comfortable there they understand the interface it's in a place they are already choosing to spend time we can't be out there trying to sell our stuff to school districts and they buy all of it and then it kind of gets forced on the teachers no we just want to be there and let teachers and students pick what they want to choose so that the only time that crash course gets used is when students or teachers find it useful and if my inability to get a mold check without someone thanking crash course for helping them get through their education is any indication i think that crash course has a pretty big impact the entire goal has to be about optimizing learning for learning about getting those barriers down as low as we can get them you can't eliminate them but you can get them lower and why is that important because the entire human story is about how effective we are at helping each other learn but pushing those barriers down isn't easy we reach a lot of people at crash course and we try to keep our budget low but it costs a lot of money 37 percent of our budget comes from our patreon and from the crash course coin a beautiful coin minted in arkansas from hand engraved dies we've sold out of the 10 000 learner coins but the 2022 2000 learner coins are still available and will be through this weekend but then never ever again if you want to help crash course do this work and you have a hundred dollars to spare and i totally understand if you do not there's a link in the description john i'll see you on tuesday [Music] you good morning john everyone is talking about student loans incorrectly and it's making me frustrated so i'm making a video about some flat decontextualized numbers for you there's 1.75 trillion dollars of outstanding student debt in america held by around 45 million students that is roughly 39 000 of debt per student and what you would imagine given those numbers and what most people do imagine is the average college graduate headed out to the workforce with 39 000 of debt and this is entirely wrong first let us not forget about the 35 of people who get a degree and do not have student loans that number was a lot bigger than i expected it to be and i think it's important to say that it exists and that those people have like a leg up on the 65 percent of the students who graduate with that second this won't surprise you but you may not have noticed it the average student debt holder didn't just graduate they graduated a while ago and they have either been paying down their student debt or they haven't been in which case it's actually gone up due to interest so the 39 thousand dollars isn't what they come out with it's what is left after having been paid down so but even weirder the average student graduating from a four-year college or university has about 28 000 of student debt so it is strange that the average student debt holder has 39 000 of student debt what's going on here graduate school is mostly what's going on here here's the weirdest plot twist in all of this people who take out more student loans are less likely to default on their student loans much less likely in fact as you take out more and more student loans you become less and less likely to default on them so i guess we figured it out students just need to take out more student loans and everything will be better no something weird is going on here and we have to figure out what it is what is the weird thing that's going on well first people with a lot of student loans tend to be doctors and lawyers so that's one bit of this the bigger more surprising more upsetting reason that this is the case is that 40 of people with student loans dropped out without getting a degree this is a wide variety of kinds of people but they are more likely to be black and hispanic they are more likely to have gone to a high school in a low-income area they're more likely to be older when they start college and they're more likely to be first-generation students and their loans tend to be smaller because they tend to go to cheaper schools for not as long loan delinquency for this group is quadruple loan delinquency for people who graduated now again there are lots of reasons why people might be in bad situations with regard to their student loans and it's often not because they didn't graduate but this seems like a cohort that we don't talk about and a problem that we don't interface with very much and it is a very big problem like i'll say it again 40 of people with student loans are not going to get a degree this all happens for predictable reasons the biggest one being financial pressure college doesn't just cost the money you're spending but also your near-term lost income which is vital to many people and the support that they have to give to their families and the second biggest cause academic disqualification is caused by students not getting a good enough high school education being under-supported or over-committed during school there are a lot of hard parts and failures in higher education but taking billions and billions of dollars per year of financed money from students who aren't going to end up with a degree like that's astounding and it is infuriating to me this is the exact problem that crash course and arizona state university are trying to take on with our partnership providing structures to help students make good decisions earlier in their higher education process so they don't end up making expensive mistakes and also helping them learn information that they may not have been taught well in high school or may have forgotten since this is a very common outcome at some schools it is the most common outcome and i do not understand why we don't talk about it more because the result of not talking about it is understanding the student debt crisis entirely and correctly when we forgive debt 40 of the people whose debt is being forgiven are people who didn't end up with a degree students that didn't fail but were failed and on average people who have debt and no degree have around thirteen thousand dollars of debt we need to take on the student loan crisis and we also need to take on the dropout rate crisis not just with one-time debt forgiveness but by supporting students who are working to make their lives better john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john around 10 years ago i was scheduled to make a video on december 14 2012. i had a whole idea for it and then the sandy hook attack happened and i did not know what to do so i made a short video trying to be honest about where i was in that moment and i just went back and watched that video and my takeaway from that is that in that moment the unique tragedy of sandy hook felt very unique there had been other mass shootings and school shootings that created terror and horror and tragedy but like a young adult walking into an elementary school with an ar-15 i could not imagine that and this time we had all imagined it we'd spent 10 years imagine it we've spent 10 years preparing children for it i got a letter from our school yesterday talking about the precautions they take and like no like there aren't any precautions we can't put the responsibility on schools to handle men with weapons of war we cannot educate our children in bank vaults we can't put razor wire around the playground it feels like this country is being constantly re-traumatized and that is made worse when we ask our leaders to try out some solutions and we hear some of them respond now is not the time for politics and this phrase can be heard in two very different ways because one definition of politics is the stuff we do to govern and by that measure this is certainly the time for politics because political leaders are elected to implement policy and a majority of americans want meaningful policy changes when it comes to gun safety but of course there's also another meaning to the word politics it's the game it's the jockeying for favorability politics as theater manipulating the electorate and doing all your fundraising and i agree with that this is not the time for theater it's the time for the other kind of politics the actual doing things kind but instead when they say this is not the time for politics what they're doing is the second kind of politics they're waiting until we get over it until the news cycle gets done with it and simultaneously they're saying americans who have concerns about gun safety they're not worried about kids they're just playing politics and that is disgusting the fear of having your child not come home from school one day is just about the biggest possible fear and so it seems like people who oppose gun safety legislation or want to use it as a wedge issue have had to match that with a similarly big fear but what fear could be that big how could the fear of taking away not even your current assault rifle but your right to buy one in the future in any way match the fear of having your child taken away well what about the fear of having everything taken away so that's what many of them resort to their argument is often literally that americans need guns to fight against their government people who want gun safety legislation want their leaders to take this problem seriously and it's not like it isn't a problem because guns are now the number one killer of people under the age of 19. but after sandy hook when bans on assault rifles or universal background checks were proposed the counter to the fear of losing your child in a school shooting was the fear that your government is a menace that cannot be trusted and so you must be armed to protect yourself against them this is a fringe belief that has been promoted by politicians and pundits in order to create a wedge that can help them win elections sandy hook has a lot of legacies but the politicians and pundits who took the absolutely legitimate interest americans had in gun safety legislation and used it as a wedge not just to fight that legislation but to delegitimize the government that they are sworn to uphold that is the very worst of the second kind of politics and every time they say this is not the time for politics that's the kind of politics i hear your job is to take this country's problems seriously not to drum up fear to manipulate others into hating and being terrified of their fellow citizens and their government so that you can win a primary john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john there's a little section of sidewalk that i walk down pretty frequently and i think that what happens is there's a convenience store nearby people pick up like a bag of chips or a drink and then when they're walking home sometimes they drop the thing on the ground after they're done with it i do not like this it makes me upset it makes me feel like i'm like surrounded by people who do not respect the space that we share and that is irrational it takes one person walking back and forth to the store every day and dropping a piece of trash on the ground for there to be 30 pieces of trash after a month that's a lot of trash it changes the way that it looks but it also might be one person of the hundreds of people who go to that convenience store every day so like almost no one litters but the street is covered with trash and here's the way of thinking about this that really changed my mind it only takes one person every day picking up two pieces of trash for there to be no trash after two weeks one of the best tools i have ever been taught for how to understand our world is that we often like our minds imagine the world as like set quantities but actually set quantities are made up of inputs and outputs a street with no glitter is not a street that never gets littered on it's a street where the rate of people dropping trash is lower than the rate of people picking up trash it's a flow in and out litter goes down litter goes and the person who dropped the trash is only half of the reason that the trash is there the other half of the reason is that i didn't pick it up i'm not like equally morally responsible for the trash on the ground but i don't really care about morality here i care about the trash that's on the ground removing responsibility and ethics from the conversation the trash wouldn't be there if somebody had picked it up right and so i do pick it up i pick it up like every time and catherine is like oh my god where where are you going now just across the street to get that half empty malt liquor bottle i'm not doing this because i think that leaving litter on the ground is like equally morally problematic to dropping the litter in the first place but i think that we can all sort of vaguely agree that like dropping some trash on the ground is an amount some amount of disrespectful to the space and if that's the case then picking it back up and not having to be there anymore is like an equal and opposite amount of respectful now litter on the street in my neighborhood is not something that i'm actually that concerned about like not one of the world's biggest problems and pretty much every problem that isn't a bag of doritos in your neighbor's hedge is more difficult to solve than like bending over and bending back up but i find this a useful model when thinking about problems generally because it tells me three things first one person can drop a lot of trash just because there's a lot of trash doesn't mean that all people are dropping trash second bad things are not static they are a result of inflows and outflows and we cannot stop all bad things from happening but we can focus on decreasing the rate of problem formation and on increasing the rate of problem solving and finally it is almost always easier to get mad about something than to do something about it even if the doing of the something is very small and that is an instinct in me that i need to fight against john i'll see you on tuesday i just finished editing this video and discovered that there's a full minute of time that i have which never happens to me but since i have extra time i would like to encourage you to go to youtube.com scishowtangents to watch uh the video version of scishow tangents that we are now doing if you want to subscribe there that would be wonderful tangents is like a comedy game show science podcast that i do with a couple of people uh sari riley and sam schultz where we try to like surprise each other with science facts it's a very good time you can listen to it as a podcast wherever you get podcasts but also now as of this week we're starting to upload it onto youtube since i had extra time i figured i'd let you know about a thing that i'm excited about john again i will see you on tuesday good morning john so i'm doing this apparently let's do a timeline on march 25th elon musk tweeted a poll it said free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe that twitter rigorously adheres to this principle the next day after 70 of the 2 million people who voted in that poll said that they did not quote tweeted that poll saying given that twitter serves as the de facto public town square i will give you a de facto public town square i will not give you the failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy what should be done is a new platform needed not long after that he announced that he had entered into an agreement to buy twitter that was a very loud week and the takes were very hot but there was a concern that i think has borne out that elon musk has kind of viewed twitter from a really particular lens as a guy who was a billionaire with 80 million followers it's not the most typical twitter experience one very well-known effect in the social internet is that in spaces where harassment is allowed to sort of run unchecked a lot of people just leave which is kind of empowering for the harasser because they get to see that their harassment has resulted and the voices of the people they chased away no longer being heard in that space and harassment is always going to affect people with less power more than people with more power that's just how it works so i understand people being concerned by the thought that the man with the most money in the world would be in charge of moderation decisions for a de facto town square elon's answer to this is that he won't be in charge of moderation decisions because all moderation will be based on whether or not something is illegal and after i'm sure hearing a lot of frustration and concern about this he tweeted this the extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all by free speech i simply mean that which matches the law i am against censorship that goes far beyond the law if people want less free speech they will ask government to pass laws to that effect therefore going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people and then there was a period of time of around three weeks when people started to ask elon musk some of the more complicated questions around speech and moderation on the internet and then this week he said this they say something that is illegal or otherwise you're just destructive to the world then then that there should be perhaps a timeout a temporary suspension or that particular tweet uh should be made invisible or or have very limited uh traction if there are tweets that are wrong they should and bad those should be either deleted or made invisible so speech that is illegal or otherwise destructive to the world or wrong or bad this isn't a man who doesn't want twitter to do subjective moderation it's a man who wants twitter's subjective moderation to work the way he wants it to and that is because as a lot of people were saying including me not to brag no one thought who knew about this that we were going to end up with a twitter without subjective moderation like that's just not on the table where do you draw the line that's the whole hard part we were not having an extreme antibody reaction to the idea of free speech we were telling him what it would take him a mere three weeks to figure out for himself which is that twitter without subjective moderation cannot function as of this morning elon musk says that his deal to buy twitter is temporarily on hold as he investigates whether or not twitter's claims about how many of its users our bots are accurate i don't know what this means and and during this sort of initial hubbub about this i wasn't that interested in talking about what elon musk was going to do to twitter because i knew that this wasn't a done deal and also by the way he was talking about it i knew that he hadn't thought really critically yet about how moderation on a many-to-many content platform works but i was really interested in the conversation that it started about how difficult moderation is on these platforms about how yes they have got it wrong in the past and about how maybe the problem isn't that twitter like isn't relentlessly dedicated to the idea of free speech maybe the problem is that we have allowed and invited a private company into the role of de facto town square that is the thing that seems like the problem and it doesn't seem like a problem that gets solved by elon musk buying twitter but it is a problem that gets solved by something cause hey nothing lasts forever jon i'll see you on tuesday good morning john two days ago dan howell uploaded a video called why i quit youtube and the first half of it is one of the most eloquent thoughtful and in my opinion accurate takes on the history of youtube and the many bad parts of being a youtuber and there's not much i can add to it like it's very good i agree with everything in it which is weird because i've talked to dan like twice in my life also it's 85 minutes long and we have a four minute time limit but listening to a summation of some of the worst parts of the last 15 years of my life did make me kind of wonder why why didn't we quit why haven't we burned out on this why didn't we focus on some of the many other things that we had to focus on and just like sorry youtube we're done certainly a lot of other people have done that and i respect that decision a lot like i understand and i can't answer this question for you john cause i think this is very personal i think that different people respond to all of this stuff very differently but i can think back to the times when i did kind of entertain the idea of maybe quitting and it has been because the weight got too heavy for the support that i had to carry and to get an idea here are two of the the forms that that wait has taken first feeling a responsibility that i don't know that i can live up to to be like everyone's unproblematic king like to not only be what i have attempted to say that i am which is already a fairly high standard but also to be what everyone is imagining me to be which is of course impossible because people imagine different things like occasionally i will say something on twitter that is something that i have believed for a long time like since high school and people will be like wow man you've changed and i'll be like yes i have i have but not in that not that thing that thing has been the same so that's hard and one thing i think a lot about is that like people have too many reasons to kind of lose faith in the world right now um and i the last thing i want to be is one of them another form that the weight can take is just having people really dislike me and be mean to me on the internet it's a thing that happens it hasn't happened in a while but it has happened and it's bad so in those moments when it has been bad that has made me feel like why am i doing this i don't have the support necessary to carry this weight and john i think that we have been very lucky in both the weight department like not carrying as much as we might have if we got less lucky or had different lives and in the support department where we just have good support good support which can be both internal and external like i am my own support but i have support around it allows you to not just like handle the weight when it's like sort of piling on but to enjoy it when it's like an appropriate amount because of course some weight is good i want some responsibility i want people to rely on me i want to be held to a standard i want to take what we have regardless of whether we deserve it because what is deserving and do the best things we can with it that is what makes the weight actually feel good and that is i think why this community has done so much different stuff over the years we kind of shoulder it all together and we do good things with it like for example the awesome socks club which has donated over a million dollars to partners in health for our work in sierra leone we have a short sign up window open now if you want to check it out there's a link in the description every week i make a video it could be my last video and i know a hundred percent that everyone watching would be supportive of me stepping away if i felt like i had to i did not upload this video today because i felt like i had to i uploaded this video today because i feel like our work here isn't done and i don't know if i could have articulated that before i watched a dan's video so dan thank you for that after 15 years because of your support and our parents support and our friend support and catherine and sarah's support and the support of all the people we work with at complexly and dftba and you know hopefully by engaging thoughtfully in what we are attempting to do it's not like we don't talk about it a lot we talk about it a lot we've been able to continue creating together and the weight has for the most part remained healthy and the support for the most part has remained strong how i'm feeling after all that is just grateful to have had the luck and the support that we have without which to be certain we would have gotten all these cool things done and we would have quit like that's absolutely true so to everybody who's been a part of this thank you um thank you thank you we're very lucky john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john one of the things that we are asked to do as humans is to understand things that are far outside of our lived experience like i know what a mile is i've walked a mile and i kind of know what a thousand miles is because i've driven a thousand miles what about a million miles we kind of break a little bit outside of our personal experience but luckily humans have had some time to develop tools to deal with this these are important tools to develop i want to share with you five of them the earth is around 25 000 miles in circumference this is luckily almost exactly 40 000 kilometers both of those are easy numbers to remember but are they easy to understand yes kind i can take the thousand miles that i have driven and imagine doing that 25 times that gives me an idea but eventually this strategy breaks when you have to start multiplying numbers that on their own don't make any sense like i don't understand what a million a thousand times is because those are both hard to understand numbers so what do you do with that our minds have difficulties distinguishing between percentages and absolutes going from a hundred to a thousand is the same percentage increase as going from a hundred million to a billion but in absolute terms this is the difference between 900 and 900 million visualizations can be useful for helping understand these absolute differences a stack of a million dollars is a whole lot smaller than a stack of a billion dollars visualizations aren't always easy to find or to create so let's look at another way that doesn't require all that work the classic example here is that a million seconds is around 11 days and a billion seconds is around 32 years i know what 11 days is like and i kind of know what 32 years is like mostly i know that they are very different from each other in the same way the distance from the earth to the moon is around 250 000 miles and from the earth to the sun around 93 million that means nothing to me but if you're going 70 miles an hour you can get to the moon in four years and you can get to the sun and 150. now that still kind of means nothing to me because i've never driven a car for four years or 150 years but i get the scale of the difference but what if i'm less interested in like the relative difference between the numbers and more interested in like the absolute impact of the numbers often if i actually want to understand how big a number is i don't look at the number i look at the number per unit of relevant things often times i just like to divide by the number of people in the u.s like 44 billion dollars is 130 per person in the u.s including all of the babies 44 million dollars with an m is 13 cents per human in america so calculating relative impact gives us some really good data but not as much as our final strategy often times absolute numbers are not particularly useful when it comes to understanding the world if you add up local state and federal spending the government in the us spends around 20 thousand dollars a year per person i actually have a pretty good conception of what twenty thousand dollars is but i don't know what that number means i have no idea if that is the right number i could just go on my gut and say that sounds like a lot or like not enough like i don't know instead we can compare and we can see that the us and the uk and germany and france all spend roughly the same amount per citizen norway which has a bunch of money from oil is about 30 000 india is about 1800 these numbers are just a lot more useful in comparison to each other than they are in absolute terms but if you track government spending per unit of economic production you actually get a very tight correlation bigger economies have bigger state budgets always and there isn't actually that much variation from country to country almost as if a lot of the arguing is about relatively small policy differences and it might actually be better to measure other things like how effective tax policy is at reducing inequality in a specific country well done ireland so experiential extrapolation visualization understandable comparison relevant impact calculation and of course more useful metrics are all excellent strategies that do different things for us on our quest to better understand our world john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john this is my office i've been making videos in here for like eight years i feel like i've never showed anyone around maybe i should do that today the thing about me is that i'm sort of hyperactively focused on whatever current problem i am trying to solve and so i don't take a lot of time to like look back at what i did in the past how i get around that is by putting things on my walls that i will see that remind me of things that that have happened that i have liked for example this is a piece of art by emily grassley that she made for me when she left missoula this is the tour poster for the hank green and the perfect strangers this is the map of the world that titan's great took place in sorry you can't see it very well this is my joko cruise poster signed by a bunch of joko cruise people this is a bowling pin from the time that i bowled a 199 in 2013. if you watched every vlogbrothers video you recognize this and what it is but if you haven't tell me what you think it is here we have a stack of business cards i'm never gonna look at and this is my tote full of conference badges that's uh vidcon london right there this is the x-wing that catherine and i made during the video that at the very end of a very long video we announced that we were having a baby where's the baby i'm a small infestation of these little guys right now this was from the merch table of our tour where we were selling gilbart pins for eight dollars if you understood what that meant thank you thank you for your support i used to think i might do a gaming channel which is why this corner looks like this but it looks cool so i've left it obviously things have not gone great for this guy the head is ah there he is that's curiosity up there next to the air conditioner this is a piece of art from vihart gotta have some star trek the next generation and then maybe giants or i don't feel comfortable now i don't have a gaming channel anymore so i have instead a microscopy station which has brought me a tremendous amount of joy i really can't keep the heads on my bobble head that is a zay frank ducky and if you want to go very very far back into the history of vlogbrothers this is the misprinted business card cube that's some 2007 stuff right there here are a lot of pins that i have collected over the years this is a spur if you want to put on your boot to like jingle around when you walk but actually i got for doing an event at university of texas at austin what is inside the chest though oh we can't talk about that down here is the lizzie bennet diaries dvd set so you can watch it on dvd which i can't do because i don't have a dvd player this month is actually the 10 year anniversary of the first episode of lizzie bennet diary and actually ashley clements who played lizzie bennet is doing a watch through vlog this year so if you want to join here i'm going to be on a few episodes of it you can find it's called look back diaries this down here is my collection of various coins mostly project for awesome but there's also my bim bam one there's a lore one also and here's one of my favorite things that i have let me try and get it out these are a bunch of different kinds of crash course coins so like different looks different feels as we were planning out the first crash course coin of what what was what is possible what we could do like obviously this doesn't make sense but this is just a bunch of different things that they could have done for that coin um and we also things that we could do for future coins i love these very much i honestly think it's because in my head these coins have a lot of value like they are the thing that keeps crash course going people who buy these so having like exclusive versions of them like really gets my collector sense going even though no one knew that they existed until now but nobody can have them they're mine up there that tie is a tie that mr rogers wore not actually one that he wore but he wore that that plaid which our dad bought for me you probably got one too john he's a good dad and then of course we got the meat furby and up there's the bean furby very good pizza john thank you to this person and of course we still have and we'll always have the map of the realm of narnia behind me that's the kurt's gazette calendar this is my first ever badge to a vidcon so that's what it looks like in here this is the place where i spend a lot of my time i hope that was somewhat enjoyable for you i know it was for me john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john panics are not that unusual but they do seem to be all stacking up on each other this is partially the fault of the world like there are some really real problems out there i think that this is more than just like a normal reaction to an imperfect world seem to be finding it easy to get angry and scared on a surface level but hard to get engaged in deeper more helpful ways now sometimes this is because of like legitimately awful people who find it useful to manipulate people into being scared so that they can get them to watch their youtube videos or follow them on twitter or vote for them but also it seems like it's just how communication works on the internet right now it is easier to have simple takes it is easier to share them it's easier to make people aware of the definite obvious clear problem than it is of the misty vague and uncertain solutions i think that all of these things add together to get a lot of people stuck in a place that i am now naming it is the sad gap here's how learning about a new problem works at first you might know that a problem exists but you aren't really aware of it you're not worried about but then as you earn more you get exposed to the definite real concrete inexcusable terrible frightening consequences of that problem and often you are also exposed to the people who either create the problem or are preventing it from being solved and usually though not always this is presented in a way that is oversimplified in order to make you more likely to engage with content because if you don't engage with content then the idea doesn't spread and so now you have entered into the sad gap here in the sad gap it seems that there is quite a lot of evil around evil is what is creating the problem evil is what is preventing it from getting solved and from this perspective it is very difficult to imagine how you or anyone else could ever solve this problem so the sad gap is the place where you mix together outrage and hopelessness and that is always a place that is going to be filled with anxiety and depression and panic but this is not the sad place this is the sad gap as you learn more about a topic you find complexity maybe you realize that fossil fuel workers don't imagine themselves as darth vader's supervillains but as the people who made it possible for your house to be warm and your refrigerator cold and maybe you see that the cost of solar power keeps going down and that we have for the first time since the industrial revolution decoupled economic growth from carbon emissions you see people working to solve the problem maybe you even become a person who is solving the problem but you can't believe that a problem is solvable when you're in the sad gap and you certainly can't help solving here's an incomplete list of things that i'm worried about right now and it is i dare say it too long but there's also nothing i'd take off of it and likely quite a lot that should be added but if i keep adding things it's very easy to enter the sad gap on all of them but hard to find the time to move through it to the other side on any of them especially because the people who make content and the people who share content which is all of us are encouraged by our minds and by the structure of an internet that is designed to always keep us from leaving it to only add stuff to the list and never go deeper on anything especially because going deeper is way more work and so we have all been driven into the sad gap on a lot of different topics all at once and i think that's bad it makes us depressed anxious and easy to manipulate and so now i have put you in a weird place potentially into the sad gap sad gap you now know about a new problem and you don't feel like there's any good solutions out there and it would have been easy for me to talk about this in simpler ways and to blame more people particularly i could have placed a lot more blame at the feet of social media platforms than i did i think that would just be an oversimplification that would make us feel like this is being caused by evil rather than by it just being a problem that should be solved all i wanted to do in this video is to outline that this thing exists that it is too easy to get to the place and knowledge where you are sad and angry and too hard to cross the gap over to being engaged and helped and there are not always ways across the sad gap but usually there are but i do not have time to talk about them in this video because i'm up on four minutes here so john i need you to tell me yours and your video when i see you on tuesday good morning john i've been a little bit stuck recently i think i've been stuck because i often don't know what the right thing is to look at like what's the right thing to see i went on vacation to seattle last week it was the first real vacation i've been on in a long time it was the first real vacation oren has ever been on and we did a lot of fun stuff it was very good one of my favorite parts and he liked it a lot too was just watching the ships come into and out of the port oren would shout whenever we saw a new ship coming or going and we'd run to the window and we'd watch the tugs push it where it was going and then we'd watch all of those containers that had who knows what inside of them getting moved around the port and get ready to be shipped inland or had overseas and i can look at these ships and heat them burning 30 gallons of fuel every mile they travel pumping co2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere and i can look at them and love them people working hard to engage in the tremendous collaborative effort of delivering for all i know awesome socks or micro cosmos microscopes i can look at them and think that they are ugly i can look at them and think that they are beautiful i can look at them and think that they are old and outdated i can look at them and think that they are a tremendously recent innovation i don't know what the right way to see these things is i'm not in crisis i just had a lovely vacation i have lots of support but being 41 years old in the year 2022 has not given me the kind of clarity i expected from middle age if anything things have gotten less clear as i have gotten older i used to think that the scars we've left on this planet and on each other were purely the result of malice or evil or at best ignorance but now i look at those scars and i still see the ones made by hate and ignorance but i also see a lot that are just made by living by love by trying by pushing maybe too hard too fast because of hubris or maybe just because of excitement and joy and hope and community and mutual thriving and fun i look around me right now sitting at my desk i see things that have done harm my iced tea bottle the chicken sandwich that i shouldn't have bought the websites that let us share with each other and tear at each other but i'm also surrounded by things that i love like my iced tea and the chicken sandwich that i can't quit and the websites that let us share with each other and tear at each other i'm not saying i don't think awful cynical greedy people exist they do some people carefully cultivate fear like it's a crop for them to harvest on election day we are surrounded by harm and we are surrounded by aid we are surrounded by joy and surrounded by sorrow i guess i do know now that nothing gets done if there is no room for joy i know that nothing gets done if we only see the harm and nothing gets done if we don't see the harm so i don't know which thing to see more i don't know if i'm seeing the right amount of joy or the right amount of harm or the right amount of grief or the right amount of aid but i know that i have to see both and there is a way of doing this where i see one and then the other and then the one and then the other the horror then the beauty then the grief then the joy but that way of doing it doesn't seem to be helping me get anything done so maybe there's a way to look at the world and see both at the same time john i'll see you on tuesday [Music] you good morning john 10 years ago when we first started making crash course i had a pretty specific idea of what kind of help students needed in high school and college they needed better tools for learning and they do and i'm really proud of the work that crash course has done in that space but also during those 10 years the outcomes for your typical high school junior have not been great 84 percent of those kids want to continue their education after high school but only about 66 percent of them will and of the people who go on to college only 60 of those people will actually get a degree and so yes about 40 of americans with student loans are not gonna get a degree my first impulse when hearing this is this is a learning problem we need to teach these kids better and that is part of the problem but arguably the larger part is just understanding how this tremendously complex system works admissions financial aid credit transfer degree paths a huge variety of institutions with a huge variety of systems only 20 of students receive counseling on how best to pay for college only 30 receive counseling on how admissions work and worst of all of course the people for whom this is hardest are the ones who get the least support from their institutions and systems and they're also the ones who on average have the least time and money to deal with if you need more aid and more loans it's much more likely that you have a full-time or part-time job during the period during which you are applying for school you're also much more likely to have unpaid work doing child or elder care and you're less likely to have other people in your life who have gone through and experienced these systems who can give you advice everything from loans to majors to transferring credits from community college class election career counseling financing this is a big messy bureaucracy and anybody who interfaces with it even people inside of it will tell you this they know that it's hard the less you know the more likely you are to end up in a situation where you've boxed yourself into a bad outcome or you may even be being taken advantage of by bad institutions the inability to make an informed decision when it's one of the most important decisions you're ever gonna make is a big reason why so many students end up with loans but no degree and we understood none of this when we were first making crash course so over the last couple of years for you and me and a lot of people who work at complexly we've undergone a bit of a crash course and understanding how higher education actually works in this country and we had a little bit of help with that so i am excited to be telling you that in partnership with arizona state university we are launching a new youtube channel called study hall and also we are launching a new course on crash course it's called crash course how to college a course that takes on all of the options a person in the u.s has to face when considering their future from financial aid to admissions to majors and careers now we already made a series of courses with asu under the name study hall with a specific goal of helping people with the subjects that most interfere with a student's ability to succeed in early college but now we are launching the study hall project as a whole youtube channel starting with a series that i'm extremely excited about it's called fast guides the fast guides are a quick but pretty deep dive into what you're getting yourself into when you're choosing a major what work can you expect what skills do you need what are good alternatives if you want to switch majors from that major and what do graduates in that major end up doing after graduation i am so excited about these two new things i have learned so much about why they are necessary please check out crash course how to college and the study hall youtube channel and send them to everyone you know who might be going to college in the near future including yourself i have seen the tremendous amount of work and thought and care that has gone into these things and i know that when good people work hard together they really can help to solve hard problems so tell everyone you know there are links in the description and also probably right here john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john this week i spent more than a few moments being frustrated that it was not the right time like putting my son to sleep an hour before he thinks it's his bedtime which resulted in of course him sitting in the bed and saying but dad i'm not sleepy which like of course you're not it was frustrating and no one liked it and thus we began our biannual tradition of tweeting together about how we don't like that this thing happens can we please just stop changing the clock and then the us senate was like okay like all of them a hundred percent of the senate democrat and republican and like whatever else we have now they agreed yes this is silly and we don't like it and it makes us all very sleepy and you wouldn't like me when i'm sleeping no this is not the full process of a bill becoming a law but the unanimity does indicate that it might very well be a thing that actually happened but john something amazing happened the moment that 100 of the senate was like yes we agree on this suddenly a lot of people were mad the disagreement that i saw was of two kinds the first and most common was of this sort oh so the senate can do things when they are easy and free but they can't do things when they are contentious and complicated and expensive what a terrible country look i don't want to be mean about this but i'm a little bit sleepy so i'm not making great decisions if the choice was between universal health care and not changing my clocks twice a year i would take universal health care but that's not the choice the choice is should we do this easy and free thing that everyone wants us to do or not and if your response to bipartisan legislation that will make your life better is i have nonetheless found a way to be angry about it i think maybe the problem isn't in the congress it might be in your chair and on to the second thing which i was genuinely shocked by because of course everyone agrees that we should stop changing the clocks but there are two ways you can do it you can stick with standard time or you can stick with daylight time and congress wants to stick with daylight time and there's a bunch of people who want to stick with standard time and i'm like oh my god how have we found a way to argue about this let's just make the change oh my god no but just for clarity the change that the senate just unanimously agreed on is keeping daylight savings time all year round which means later sunrises and later sunset here are two of the reasons people are mad one i don't want my kid waiting at the bus stop in the dark they might get kidnapped or hit by a car and number two it's anti-science because the society for research on biological rhythms said that it would be better for people to have more light in the morning than have more light in the evening i've looked at some of these papers and indeed it seems that there are some very small but detectable differences in the health outcomes of people who live on the far western portions of time zones where sunrises are later and sunsets are later but there's also research showing that when there's later sunsets kids get more exercise there are fewer pedestrian fatalities because people drive around mostly after work rather than before work and also maybe there's an effect on crime but again all three of those things the effects are really small and when you ask people which might also be important they say they would rather have the extra hour of daylight in the evening when they are more likely to you know like use it and thus as with so much in our society whether daylight savings time forever or daylight savings time never is the better solution is unclear and complex and i have decided to do a wildly controversial thing and not care at all about which way we go here's what i'll say and i think that this is important perfect is subjective it's different for every person and so we are not going to get to perfect for everyone we might get the perfect for you but there will be people for whom this will be imperfect but while perfect is subjective in this case for once better is very clear so let's stop the war on the clocks and just do whatever lawmakers will agree on john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john earlier this week i tweeted a question that i thought was interesting do you think we will still be using phones in 200 years and by phones i mean cute little hand computers side note i maintain that we call these things phones because we saw that their implications were so psychologically overwhelming we needed to give them a name that was really familiar being a phone is one of the 500 things this does like calling it a phone is like calling it a flashlight but whatever steve jobs was like iphone so we're stuck with phone it will always be called a phone i think this is a really interesting question because we've had these things for like 15 years so not very long and yet life seems kind of impossible without them like hear the kinds of answers i got to this question number one i sure hope not i hope that i'm not using my phone in x number of years but do you do you really i like this thing i don't just use it because i'm addicted to it it is a shockingly useful rectangle some people thought that we were going to return to a slower more traditional way of life i don't really see that happening personally some thought that in 200 years we'd exist in some kind of metaverse where we wouldn't need any physical objects at all that also seems unlikely to me to me like i don't know some people thought that their functionality would be somehow implanted into our eyeballs or our skin or whatever like i think that that might that's possible but also even with that i think would also be nice to have a sturdy little rectangle around but also a very common response to this question was hank you think humans are going to be around in 200 years implying in a joking way that like arc do you think we can make it through this now i admit to being the more optimistic of the duo here um but i think that both of us john agree that humans are going to exist in 200 years and probably with significantly more advanced technology than we have right now like that's the most likely outcome look i get it we're not done with the pandemic part and yet we are transitioning somehow into the the tremendous geopolitical instability caused by a dictator with a bunch of nukes invading a neighboring country and starting a horrific and unnecessary war part and we get to do that under the cloud of a global climate changing faster than it maybe has ever changed in the history of the planet it doesn't feel good i agree we've got like the cultural upheaval of a communications technology revolution lining up with the physical upheaval caused by an energy revolution that occurred over the last 200 years and yes humans do have the technology necessary and the weapons built to destroy ourselves many times over why i don't know i don't know why why also i get that this is a joke it's just a joke that i hear a lot and i'm starting to like less maybe it's the repetition but mostly it's the sort of like giving into hopelessness vibe that like that's the sort of fun thing to do is just be like ah hopelessness let's just give up everybody i'm not saying that we are actually giving up i don't see anyone actually giving up i'm just saying talking about it makes it seem like giving up might be the cool thing to do when it's definitely not like it's a betrayal of the future it's a betrayal of the past too it's also a betrayal of the present don't give up we are only past saving when we believe that we are past savior i don't see anyone acting that way not even close i see people working hard for themselves and their families in their countries and their planet i see people disagreeing but i don't see them anywhere close to giving up this is a hard moment and obviously different scales of bad for different people and i don't know what to do about it i read commentary from experts i listen to them interviewed on podcasts and what i hear is this is bad we don't know how to fix it and we don't know what the future holds but i do know that 15 years ago we thought this might be a fun when i graduated from college i could not imagine this thing even existing i had an mp3 player that could fit 13 songs on it and now i am having a hard time imagining a future 200 years from now where we don't have them we never know where we're headed times are rarely precedented but no one is acting like they're hopeless and that gives me plenty of hope john i'll see you on tuesday well good morning john i am still recovering in various ways from the project for awesome the last of my physical consequences is that i put a lot of socks on my hand at one point wasn't a big part of the project for awesome there were so many socks and they pushed on my hand so much that i got an ingrown hair on my hand and it hurts i am however still working through my my emotional and psychological consequences one way to do that is with a project for awesome meme review last year i was able to go through pretty much everything that was uh uh sort of created as a part of the project for awesome this year there were over 600 pieces of art and memes i have narrowed that down to 250 of them and there are last year there were three categories this year there are six we've got crank green we've got john purple we've got two the moon we've got other we've got art and there was one other thing otis memes and since this is a meme review we're gonna start off with the just memes here's one we'll never get to three million uh and the nerdfighteria says i took that personally because john was not ready to live up to all of his promises and yet now he must working all my night beans henry green gets born domino's fall 2022 john gets whammed in the stomach i call this icy milk i say in a room in my home this is not my home it looks very nice it looks very far off the ground but they took the time to make sure i was wearing weird socks which is accurate possibly there's an octopus named hank in in the nemo movies uh and in this one i'm it's it's a green one and it's looking at beanie sanford good old beanie sanfurbs came back for for uh some guest appearances but was not the mascot of this year's project for awesome we'll get to that we're gonna need a bigger banana loca because me and brennan lee milligan were trying to figure out how we're gonna stuff different things full of beans more efficiently this is john trying to to figure out the wordle with me and just not being able to hit vivid even though we had the first four letters kitty time is a finger in the project for awesome and there was an armadillo which is not a kitty but the chat was confused darcy is a dog who started a good portion of the project for awesome got a little carrot every time they hit five thousand dollars so that dog was paying close attention to the stream john persuaded the chat against tattoos hank talking about crap i was very excited about crabs this project for awesome there's always beans in the banana loca there's always money in the benin stand you got both there's both of those things happening if i had a nickel for every time hank green said corn dog asked me i'd have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird that happened twice right is it time for me to explain crank green nah let's do it later just look at it and be confused be a good crab the balloon said look at me i look wonderful i look like a crab jeez there's a lot of crab memes in here i guess i do have to explain it i i popped a balloon and it told me to be a crab and it said it said be a crab you have to be good at it part of the challenge was being good at it so i had to ask everybody very earnestly if i was a good crab and they seemed to agree that i was i'm once again asking for give me the crunch now donating to support charities nah donating so darcy gets a carrot i forgot about this moment until i saw this meme but yeah i did shout that once when someone was drawing a cursed furby i was like it's not not cursed enough yet i have to do a good crab i did shout oh my knees i did it a long time my knees hurt at one point during the project for awesome i stuffed a corn dog full of beans and this meme was made which has made me laugh more than anything else it's a normal corn dog it was not normal there were beans in it this was also made as a follow-up just to like add layers a normal corn dog it's a corn dog it was not a corn dog liking to eat their cursed foods tahan yeah so taha built a terrible sandwich and it turned out he kind of liked it i did the same thing i stuffed baked beans into a banana and like it turned out it was pretty good this is a great meme that is specific to the person who created it it's time you learn about money and the importance of please make sound financial decisions we don't vibe check on p foreign think i said this in like the first hour and i was like this is the this is correct at one point i said that i really wanted my forehead to be on wikipedia and somebody made it happen though only temporarily i didn't mean for it to be the one that i had written butt on the balloon made me do it uh is this a meme or is it just a thing that i kept saying because i popped balloons and they had tasks inside of the balloons for me so the balloon made me do a lot of things for clarity the banana loca is a device that is supposed to put filling inside of bananas and i used it to put feelings that shouldn't be in bananas and bananas and also baked beans inside of a corn dog because i because i wanted to and it turned out it was delicious so i was right have you heard the good news very early in the project for awesome i got a little bit obsessed with whether or not foreheads are part of the face it turns out according to all definitions it totally is so i gave up on that one crank is what they call the crab version doing what the balloon says knees holding me back they hurt right now they're not from being crank just from being hank make a normal project for awesome cake or make a terrible crab the terrible crab is what got made thank you chapa for the beautiful terrible crap we'll get to that body frost and baked beans really do go very well together um just like baked beans and bananas i didn't even notice there's a tiny little beanie sand verbs down in there this is just a dinosaur with a space helmet on yelling about how you are awesome and worthy of care and respect this was my desk after the project for awesome and somebody noticed the baked beans with the spoon still in and also confetti that had fallen into it right next to the fugu poison blowfish flavored potato chips from rhett and link and the mythical team i have cleaned up since i actually cleaned up kind of rapidly because i knew that if i didn't do it soon i wouldn't do it at all there is lots of confetti around there's actually some stuck to the light that's above me it is as john said everywhere like i will be finding it for years this is the story of the hour moving away from beanie sanferbs and toward crank green who at least in my portions of the stream was definitely played a starring role and i i we saw less and less of beanie as the show went on john's big moment on the other hand was this where he went for some purple hair dye this was chosen by his children and then some some mustache uh pink dye it comes from a spray paint can so just like it's it's a beautiful thing it's true there's only one way that you can kind of get away with writing blood on your head as a 41 year old so i'm glad that i found the way this is certainly the case for me uh the product for awesome is the flex tape that we all need right now to stop the giant hole in our acrylic water tank deltify which is the website that we use for our like donations crashed immediately when the project for awesome went live so uh this was created by people who during those 15 minutes when we couldn't get in were like i wanted apparently the chat didn't love my commentary when i was shoving beans into the corn dog hole another one yeah i wasn't looking at all i was i was in my own zone it was a lot of work to try and make the banana loco work correctly so you know i was just i just was saying what was happening there was a magical piece of confetti at the beginning of the stream maybe spiderweb maybe sad electricity maybe dave the fish watching over us maybe just a project for awesome america this meme always of course hits you right in the feels uh but wow they found it was that a good crab no i'm told you were the best hank using live stream time charity videos or beanie sand verbs can't you just like do this both at the same time this is the face he was so panicked about it okay i like a picasso do you want a marie condo and ask if it sparks joy or do you just want to go through your house and see what you could sell for charity because that's what john was doing and it worked when donations are sky high like a flying pizza pie it's a torrey at torres our friend from save the children who visits us every project for awesome stream to talk about the work that they are doing and that is the last of our memes actually there was one more [Laughter] john did a blindfolded taste test and uh he was tired he was tired of sardines obviously i mixed the dinosaur ones in there i didn't do a great job of categorizing it it seems like but here's some more dinosaur to the moon destin time project for awesome memes you are a t-rex at the jameson space telescope and no one can take that away from you we've also got i want to send you to the james webb space telescope that dinosaur mask and helmet really did do it it was very iconic and here's just a beautiful piece of art he's very encouraging he's on a backdrop of space i am going to send so many dinosaurs to the moon god bless destin i am once again asking you to send a dinosaur to the james webb space telescope this is what bernie sanders actually wants for the world i receive 500 for charity you receive a completely free dinosaur trip to mars it's a good deal this was super cute there was a proposal and so we have made some loving dinosaurs i don't actually know what this is about i don't know if i missed this moment or if this person just made a beautiful fairy dinosaur more dinosaur on the moon and then this one is amazing because it's all illustrated except for in the dinosaur's mouth you can actually see destiny we're gone to the moon this is a lot in one category and this category is called crank green starting off with this from rachel it's just uh i want to be a crab so now we've got album cover art for the hit single i want to be a crap this is the thing if you told me i was a bad enough crab i would have done it again and so everybody had to struggle with that decision but you were all very kind amazing pelican art i'm having the boba fish and i got a crank green on my pelican nose i'm wearing a beanie sanford shirt everything's perfect about this i want this jacket it's so cool now beanie sanford is watching me on a stage trying to be a crab and i get that and i get that i've got the word butt written on my forehead and i get that i'm saying am i doing a good job but why is there weird blue lightning coming out of my eyes it levels it up for sure but why frank's daily diet in its natural habitat i got that purely fun sweetened diced tea which i forgot that i did talk about in the beginning got chicken in my mouth we were talking about how chicken crabs like chicken and then i got a corn dog um i like this uh just because of how chaotic it is you just slap my eyes with glasses on any crab and it looks like there's crank green oh this big old face i think that this person was uh making this like sort of repeatable nft style art with beans wearing coats and this one is the crab the crab bean wearing a trench coat 473 beans in a trench coat was a an early joke that i can't even really remember the origin of i've lost it this is a cute little one somebody thought half day did this one uh obviously and oh it moves it moves it's legit this is amazing at the energy of it this was a photoshop job that i then used to create a filter so that i could actually hang out with people as crank green on the stream so anything is possible and then art was made based on that so this is like a painting version of that photoshop you got a furby crab why not be a crab you have to do a good job adorable it'll crank green there just like that's exactly what i look like then then this look at his face and then cute ones i mean there's like the hor the kind of horrifying ones with the human mouths and then there's the cute ones and the more cute ones even this one's got a plaid shirt on like i usually do and also you can see this one's got really rock hard abs and then our final piece of crank green art here here it is i get eyes normalized and i also get crab eyes thank you to elisa for that i should mention that if you want to see the creators of all of these you got the digital download bundle all of these will be uh labeled with the people who actually made this art which we were able to do this year because we had them submit it most of these some of these i found on twitter and i they were not in the digital uh nerdfighter art pack but some of them are and that brings us to now that we've done crank green we of course have to do john purple so obviously john with purple hair and a pink mustache surprisingly kind of elegant once he got through the crisis though in this picture he's definitely still in the crisis moment i know john it's not toxic they wouldn't i mean maybe a little bit look at that boy i love that one then he starts getting cool look at this boy maybe he should have a pink mustache and purple hair all the time got very good pizza john style here i would love to see it spray painted on a wall somewhere legally i got purple hair and a pink mustache and i've got a serious message to deliver this is a really cute one you got a vibe and you got a threat i think that jon made some kind of joke that was this but i wasn't there to hear it but regardless the art is beautiful this is princess pizza john from alice the skirt goes very high up but i do love it like the color scheme is great the pink mustache and the purple hair is actually really good that one's great like very very 70s freddy mercury this is a really cute look at him this is my favorite brother i love the idea of this being a batman joker like being a bad guy and like but he looks like that like what is that guy like he's not like john green he's getting business done and and if you give him a quarterly report that he's not happy with you're out look at that man i'm terrified good pizza john oh no here oh that was very small but you see it it's a princess pizza john that's so cute i love it a thousand stars how do you quantify this thank you hannah for this thing same quote again except i'm there now and it says butt on my forehead and john is looking very serious but now he's got his great it's great hair and mustache and then this with you know crank green and john purple together happy 15 years indeed what a marvelous time it has been there's a lot of other there's a good amount of 473 beans in a trench coat there's a good amount of bean crab man more beans in a trench coat crabs love chicken so if if crab was pizza john it would say chicken we've got a pelican with my glasses on got lots of crabs just drew a lot of crabs you got me hans hoffman science goth mothman can i explain it not really decrease world suck you have to do a good job kimmy made a bizarre beast's pin of crank green the bean crab not bean crab just a regular crab but he is surrounded by beans of course we talked a little bit about people getting confused uh and thinking that an armadillo was a cat this is just a lovely armadillo cat me as dr horrible getting ready to see some really dastardly experiments this is my science boy-less show mercury stardust proposed this idea which i think is a great idea that i'm not going to do here's john a hug and chewbacca i missed this part of the stream there was quite a bit of john and chewbacca stuff it's beautiful they are very happy together when brennan and i were doing banana loca stuff we found the banana logo website we found out that there was a banana loca community here's never sneezer scrooge confronting the spirits of sneezes past present and future are saying sneezing is not normal i love that he's got pizza john's face more beans in a trench coat from luisa from luna we're here because we're here pizza john this probably just should have been in the art folder this is from mickey me with butt on my head and a lot of lipstick on i mean i believed johansen to my very core that he was giving me good advice on how to put on lipstick while i was blindfolded he was like my wife says you should always push really hard like why did i think that was the real thing a person would say it turned out well for entertainment value but i cannot believe i just believed it this i love his face he looks very hardcore but he's got confetti on his hat and he's holding up his sign this is kippers he's wearing a purple mask here we are the the green brothers and we're adorable legitimately what a good couple of brothers i'm very happy to be to have this relationship in my life here's the project for awesome miracle uh confetti that was hanging in mid-air uh some kind of glitch in the simulation definitely not a spider web some more beans in a trench go and here is world suck over time and it goes down and it goes up and it goes down but over the long haul we head to a better world thank you to at waffley original and that is the last of the others which means that what we have left all that we have left is the art starting off with this we're here because we're here infinite oroboro's thing also was from waffley original look at that darcy in a dinosaur costume very good very cute chaos during dustin's segment uh we've got dustin's mike was not able to handle his enthusiasm does

verbs asking for your financial support lots of awesome socks hanging out around there this uh is a can of heinz baked bananas because i got very confused at one point i thought that somebody was saying that there were cans of bananas and it was literally like there there was no reality to this i was just confused but it was good for the art because i love this can of heinz baked banana this is is from katherine liu it's a watercolor page of a lot of the things that went down during the project for awesome so you got all the good stuff here you got dinosaurs and love on the moon you got me being a crab you got beans inside of a corn dog you got john purple you got beans and trench coat you got darcy you got crank green thank you for sharing your skill and talent some more uh dinosaurs in love on the moon this is the template for the beans and trench coats um here's one of them this is me crank and then there's there's john purple should i make this my icon on twitter i mean yeah i should this is what it's like to be inside the project for awesome here's more of crank green science bullets show i do need to get a crab shirt the light soaked days are coming i thought this was really pretty the hope is the thing with emily dickinson's forks can i explain that to you quickly no i kind of can't i just have to i just have to move on here is choppa's ridiculous crank green cake this is an actual cake that you could actually eat and it's me as a crab i don't need to talk more about that you understand how amazing that is john and i have done very few like photo shoots together we did one at vidcon where this picture came from that that you may have seen of us on a yellow background and to adapt it to include john purple and crank green you are a good burrito self-care bunny dftba baked beans with some confetti in it don't forget to be ant don't forget to be ant you got more going to the moon you got handkerfish tie-dye art you got darcy being an absolute monarch here you got john green being some kind of monarch as well i don't know where this came from i don't know if this was referencing anything in particular or if they just did it this is a beautiful piece of art of the cake itself this said this is notable and i don't know if this was something that was said on stream or if it's just uh a banana with this is notable underneath it but i liked it a lot we're here because we're here art taha's really bad sandwich i gotta say i would hate this sandwich full screen three million excitement with the dinosaur and the crab and the john john purple all together here's some art that somebody did of i think themselves enjoying the project for awesome over a long uh a long weekend i didn't see this one during the peafory at all so this one came up afterwards and that this pelican with crank green in its mouth was just absolutely extraordinarily charming to me so thank you so much for making that 23 flavors of confetti dr pepper dfdb and this sticker sheet very good i don't get this one i don't know what's going on um from sylvia here i don't know if this is a reference to something but it's really special things that make me laugh in this image one the giraffe's horn is hitting one of the lights because it's so tall two the giraffe is lifting its hand up so it can read its notes with its little backwards knee three there's another giraffe in the audience watching which gives me the vibe of supportive family member and or significant. it's got my guitar and the the open mic host is wearing a pizza drawn shirt five the woman's face as she looks to her friend like what is happening right now that woman is all of us and then maybe six the face of the open mic host who's like i don't know how to get the mic up to your mouth sylvia thank you so much and then we have just because you pelican doesn't mean you pellet should never follow that advice during the project for us but i never will and finally though i absolutely do want to go on forever and ever i'm going to end with a piece of art that it was unexpected to me i did not expect to get what this is which is a poetry collection of things that we said during the project for awesome get your greasy corn dog hands off dictionary.com face industrial complex for the love of god we lose no one at the dinah space program oh no we did lose someone destined to float forever feeling the air leak out and the void rush in this is what the balloon told me to do is what i will say to my wife later tonight that was because i just written butt on my forehead you can read that whole thing if you've got the digital download bundle as well as some several other non-meme creations and all of the art and memes that i didn't have time to show you on john and everyone who participated in the project for awesome no matter how you participated thank you so much for all of your enthusiasm your creations your donations your videos your votes it was really wonderful and exactly what i needed at that moment thank you meme reviews are exempt from the four-minute time limit as established last year and john i will see you on tuesday good morning john so there is a way in which this is you know not maybe the best time to have a charity live stream it's a messy world and we all want to know what's happening what happened what it all means i mean this is i guess this is somewhat every day we feel like this and as always lots of people have opinions and sometimes they're so strong that they present them as facts but here's the situation no one knows what the future holds and i think that that can make it difficult to focus on anything in particular but there are also ways in which this is a really good time to have a live stream john it's been years now since you have started to say to me a thing that is definitely true and then i believe which is that like it's very easy to focus on the the thing that is happening right now while ignoring more long-term crazies and so those long-term things that are really big deals don't feel like big deals because they're always there and so those problems get solved more slowly than otherwise maybe they could but catherine said something else to me this morning that i had never heard while we were walking around our neighborhood talking about how you know i was talking about particularly how powerless i felt in the moment you know a common feeling i think and she said this amazing thing that there aren't really any problems that aren't connected to the other problems so when you're working on something you're kind of working on everything especially because like ultimately there is one thing that we're all trying to do like there's one big thing it's to make the world better so as long as the thing you're working on makes the world better you are doing the thing that we're trying to do which is to make the world better not perfect better during the first half of the project for awesome we're raising money for partners in health and save the children these are two organizations that have proven themselves be quite good at looking at long-term crises and staying focused on them so that the world can get better partners in health employs over 17 000 doctors operating in 11 countries focused on everything from cancer treatment to preventing malnutrition and save the children has been operating for over a hundred years providing emergency response education programs health programs and advocacy in 2020 they supported nearly 200 million children and helped 12 million children gain access to quality education this is a big world with big problems and these are two organizations that have proven strategies to help make things better and when you go to project for awesome.com donate you can get so many different amazing things in exchange for your donations and all of it is only available during the project for awesome also this is the 15th project for awesome it's also the 15th year of vlogbrothers so a nerdfighter named jim is making a bunch of these laser-cut wall plaques the ones that you will get will say 50 years of vlogbrothers here so i'm looking forward to some donations for these so we can send some of these out to people in my opinion we have one of the best slates of p4a perks ever this year the designs are just really good and make me very happy so many things are challenge coin the socks the poster the stickers a really beautiful deck of cards and for the first time ever the project for awesome puzzle which looks amazing i love puzzles this looks like a fun one we've also of course got lots of digital perks that are all lumped together into the digital download bundle and that this year includes both all of my tick tock drafts over the last year and also all of john's including the ones that john posted for a little while and then immediately took down this is i'm not kidding over 200 total tick tocks if you get both and you do get both if you get the digital download bundle we also have matching donors right now which means that every dollar you donate gets doubled so you can go to project for austin.com donate right now we're also going to have matching donors during the second half of the project for awesome when we're going to be raising money for organizations that are voted on by this community at projectforawesome.com and of course during this whole thing we're going to be having a lovely little live stream here at youtube.com vlogbrothers which you can also find at projectforawesome.com live all of the relevant links are in the description john i'll see you today good morning john i've had a half a cup of coffee and i'm gonna do something i almost never do i'm gonna make an unscripted video about a thing that i care very passionately about you watching this video need to not want a gas stove why because they suck here's the thing that you are right about the curly q heating element stoves they are the worst they're hard to clean they're extremely hard to control like you cannot turn them on and off quickly they take forever to heat up they take forever to cool down what happened is the stove top and natural gas industry made it so that what takes the place of that in your brain is a natural gas stove that has like the little blue flames they're so beautiful that like gordon ramsay uses but what you're doing when you have a natural gas stove is burning stuff in your home which results in get this decreased indoor air quality you can get around this by like having your fume hood like going full blast and certainly never have a natural gas stove that doesn't have a hood or get this you could have an induction stove top that has more power and is easier to control than natural gas chances are there are three pipes connected to your house there's the one that brings you water that one's important the one that takes the water away we also want that and the one that brings you methane what century is this it would be like having the gas station bring the gasoline directly to your car like this is a bad idea i know what you're thinking hank there is no way that cooking my hello fresh is significantly adding to climate change and you're right but here's the thing household natural gas use is a big contributor to climate change it's just not mostly the stovetop however when natural gas companies ask people how they feel about switching their furnace from gas to electric or their water heater from gas to electric they're like i don't care whichever whatever's better i don't know because you currently have a really efficient way to get power into your home that isn't a pipe full of methane it's a power line and there are great electric water heaters and there are great electric furnaces and heat bumps but people say i want my natural gas stove but that's a tiny percentage of the methane that is actually being sold by the gas company almost all of it is used in furnaces and water heaters but as long as people are like i want to keep my gas stove it's harder to clean it makes the air inside my house dirty but house hunters says that it's a top-tier product people will keep having the natural gas companies build and replace this extremely expensive infrastructure to pipe gas into our homes and gas companies are freaking out about this and they're doing all these campaigns about how great gas ranges are even though they are objectively worse because if they can keep that toe hole they can make it make sense to keep giving you gas for those other things that electric could easily replace but look electric could also easily replace your stove because induction stove tops are better than gas and so one of the most important things that you can do as a person who is concerned about climate change is take the little thing out of your brain that says the gas stoves are the best kind of stove and look at it and be like you're a freaking idiot then you throw it onto your induction stovetop and nothing happens because that's not how it works it induces the heat in the pan the stove top itself doesn't get hot cause they're amazing so you have to put it into a pan put that on the stove top fry it up and have it with butter this is why i script that right there is why i script so that doesn't happen it's not important that you replace your gas stove right now in fact it's probably best that you don't it's important that you don't think it's better than induction because it's not because at some point in the future someone's going to knock on your door and say this area is about to have its natural gas pipes replaced and we have to decide whether or not to replace them with infrastructure that will last 60 to 80 years and if a bunch of people in your neighborhood say well i would but i really like my gas stove top it's not gonna happen and we're gonna keep burning methane in people's houses for 80 years i would be sympathetic if gas were better but it's not john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john one of the things that i am very passionate about is the idea that understanding something is a lot more valuable than just knowing that it exists like this kind of got us into a bit of a mess when it comes to pluto for example we taught a whole lot of people that pluto was a planet and now we're teaching a whole lot of other people that pluto isn't a planet but this is confusing even a little upsetting because we gave people a lot of information without any understanding we taught people that pluto was a planet but not why pluto was a planet because when we spotted it we didn't know all of the things there were to know about the solar system and maybe we thought it wasn't that complicated but it turns out it's actually very interesting pluto is a part of the kuiper belt just like ceres is a part of the asteroid belt except we didn't know that the kuiper belt existed until i was 12. that is very interesting but i think sometimes we avoid that story and instead just say pluto isn't a planet like that's the whole story somehow this is like textbook knowing is as important or even more important than understanding and that's just wrong understanding is more important than note but i often forget that this extends way beyond just science stuff which is where i spend a lot of my time thinking in fact i remember very explicitly being told what the proper structure for an essay was without ever being exposed to the idea of like why that's a good structure for an essay or even what the purpose of an essay is turns out lots of purposes for essays right now i am basically performing an essay that i wrote earlier today i have just finished the introduction but when i was writing it i didn't think to myself i need to write an introduction i thought i need to hook people in grab their attention so that i can do some work with them that introduction is going to hook you in but it's also going to provide you some context for the work that we're going to do in the body of the essay which we have now entered see making a great video to promote a charity is hard making a great video at all is hard the main thing you need though is to capture and hold people's attention and i did that with a hook that contained two things that people are passionate about education and doing it right and pluto a dwarf planet you need a similar hook when you're making a project for awesome video promoting a charity and then you need this part the body where you're actually getting the work done right now we're getting the work done it doesn't have to be long in fact it's nice if it's not too long because it's not going to be as hooky because you need to be doing work during the body for example in this case i just gave you information on how to write a good project for awesome video and if this were the body of a project for awesome video it would be talking about why the work that the organization does is important why they are good at doing that work and how they do it and look that wasn't that complicated so i'm not going to spend a lot of time on it in fact as i am speaking right now we are transitioning into the conclusion can you feel it happening it's happening right now the conclusion is a lot of restating the case but it can also be some new information like that making a project for awesome video is a way to have some real significant impact now of course not every charity featured in a project for awesome video is going to get a portion of the money that we raise but a lot of them are and that money can have real significant impacts for those organizations and even if it doesn't have that impact that organization might use your project for awesome video to promote the work that they do but you do have to make a good video and that means capturing and holding onto people's attention with some kind of introduction that might be about something completely different like this video is about how to make project for awesome videos but the introduction was about pluto i've had 15 years of practice doing this so i'm not saying that it's easy but it's not magic it's just work and i just have to say i deeply appreciate anyone who takes the time to make a project for awesome video i'm really excited to see what you come up with submissions are open now they close 48 hours before the project for awesome starts on the 25th capture and hold attention however you can make a clear simple case don't overstay your welcome and john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john a lot of people make a fair amount of noise about the number of ideas that emerge from john and hank and complexly in dftba and nerdfighteria this is not untrue we do indeed have a lot of ideas many of them quite good but while there is a website that keeps track of how long it has been since i've started a new thing it's definitely not a website of all the ideas i've had because most of them get shot down by you it's more like you convinced me that the ideas are not good and i do the same with your ideas we have a lot of ideas and we spend a lot of time talking about ideas a lot we do it so much that we have developed a kind of shorthand that might make it like impossible for someone listening to us talking about our ideas to understand what we're even talking about i might have an idea tell you about it and you would say hank like that's a fine idea but it's both a top ten and a walkman so i don't know why we would do that so because i like ideas a lot and i know other people do as well and i hopefully this these frameworks might be useful for someone else let us pull back the curtain and hope that it will be useful let us start with a walkman a lockman is an idea that has two components that make it a bad idea first it is something that is technically difficult and we are not experts in it sometimes we will call something a walkman just because of this condition like it's a good idea but we are not expert enough to pull it off but to be a true walkman it also has to be something that will definitely get done by someone else so if we worked really hard to get the technical expertise or find someone who did we could come in and do this but it wouldn't really increase the speed at which the idea happened because someone else out there is very likely to implement the idea anyway the example in the name here is the walk ban a big idea that happened when we were kids that is a portable tape player shorthand number two you can't scale a person this is what you say when an idea is permanently overly reliant on a single person that makes the idea definitionally long-term unsustainable that doesn't mean it's a bad idea but you have to know this going into it because a person eventually runs out of hours in the day or runs out of years in their life or more hopefully just runs out of the desire to keep doing that thing forever it seems trivial but you would be surprised by how often ideas end up overly reliant on a person and you need to be accounting for that and working around it when we have an idea that is okay but it gets way better when you give all the profit away to charity that's newman's owning it it's newman's owned this just makes ideas better it makes everybody involved more interested in the project because it makes it more interesting it makes it less like the normal thing that businesses do and newman zoning is a way to make a top 10 a good idea and a top ten is any idea that would be successful but wouldn't actually add very much value to the world this is an old one it comes from many years ago when we had a week on vlogbrothers where we just did top 10 lists and all those videos like 10 times better than the average vlogbrothers video but they did not grow the community they were not interesting they didn't really even teach anybody anything they were just lists and this is not an exhaustive list or anything but let us end with emperor of the world ideas these are ideas that would be really good ideas if and the if condition is everyone would just get out of my way and do what i tell them to do and agree with me this actually comes from something that nerdfighteria's resident mathematician daniel biss said to john once so it all ties together emperor of the world ideas aren't even really bad ideas they're just fantasies john has become pretty clear to me why we have been pretty good at having new ideas that aren't pretty good part of it is that we have each other to interrogate each other's ideas and we've gotten pretty good at that the bigger part of it is we have something that we understand fairly well that almost no one else has access to a fairly large group of interested passionate supportive people with really good values those people can provide an amazing activation energy for a new idea but they also provide a constraint the idea has to be within the values of the community this keeps us focused not on top tens but on things that actually provide value and are interesting and new and dynamic and weird and the results have been something that i am extremely proud to have been a part of john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john in 1969 neil diamond dropped what would become an american classic his hit sweet kerala and the only reason that is important to this video is because after he sings the name of the song sweet caroline these horns come in and for some mysterious and complicated reason it has become an american tradition to at that point of the song and then after this line [Music] you go so good so good so good if you are in america and you hear this song in public and there are a lot of people around it is extremely unlikely that you will not hear these improvised editions why am i talking about this well john back in 2017 when you and i went on tour we hatched an extraordinarily precarious plan based on this phenomenon i would play on my guitar sweet caroline and then we would instruct the audience to during the part where you would normally do the ba-ba-ba's to remain perfectly silent this is a treacherous thing this is like riding your mountain bike on the side of a cliff because you have just given everyone in the theater the power to make this not happen and everyone has to agree everyone that it should happen and because we are raised in this society and we expect the ba bapas in that moment the absence is a presence it's like a kind of silence that is louder than any other kind of silence i have ever experienced which is why when it worked it was really wonderful and it did work about 75 percent of the time the other 25 of the time someone would do it now occasionally this was an honest mistake someone had been buying their whole life it was hard to not bop up ah they accidentally bopped out or just which was adorable like those in those cases we tried again and if it worked it worked but in some cases somebody was like and then we tried again and they did it again in that case you just stopped doing it and the first time that happened john i remember us having a conversation backstage like maybe we shouldn't do that bit anymore because when it didn't work it felt pretty bad we decided to keep doing it in part because it felt so good when it worked but also because i think of how instructive it is when it doesn't work because there's a bunch of lessons you can take from this the first and easiest lesson to take is that look we're humans and if you give everyone the power to ruin something someone will and that's kind of a bummer but ultimately it's true you can't get around it but here's another lesson that it took me a long time of thinking about this to get to in the situations where there were 500 people in the room who didn't go ba-ba-ba the people in the room had a dramatically different experience than the people in the rooms where 499 people didn't go ba just totally different sets of learnings from those two experiences the people who only had it one or the other way which is everybody except for me and john just had such different moments but in both of those situations mathematically the experiences were basically identical either 500 people not making any noise or 499 people not making any noise that's the same right but it is interpreted entirely differently regardless of the fact that like mathematically every one of those rooms had functionally the same experience they did not walk away with their brains thinking the same thing it's just impossible to feel like 500 people stayed silent when only 499 did but that's not evidence that 499 people didn't do something together they did it's evidence that my brain can't interpret reality correctly but i don't think those two lessons are the only ones you can take from this so i'd be curious to hear other people's takes as well in the comments john i'll see you soon so good good morning john yesterday i was part of the unveiling ceremony of the 75th annual doomsday clock this is basically a subjective measure of how close to doom we are super fun you've probably noticed that there's been a lot of bad piling up over the last three years pandemics and climate change and rising isolationism and fascism feels reflecting that the clock has been set at 100 seconds to midnight for the last three years which is as close to midnight as it has ever been in those 75 years as the kids say big yike i is it the kids that say that when they asked me if i would be interested in giving some remarks i was like only if i can be hopeful about it and they're like of course that's yes yes we want that then i looked at a couple of the previous years and some of what was being said about this year i was like honestly this seems quite bad so then i sat down to what was a challenging writing assignment i was going to be going last after a bunch of people sort of like went over why things are particularly bad right now and in many ways worse than they have been for a long time and then say something hopeful and like ideally empower it and i want to talk about how i took that challenge on uh just as sort of a writing assignment i started out by saying that just because you might be staying in the same place doesn't mean you're not active it doesn't mean you're staggered which means that we can talk both about the good news and the bad news and there is plenty of both so that was my transition out of what i knew would be sort of bad news coming from the person before me then i zoom way out we think far more about what happened this morning than we do about what happened four billion years ago even though that thing that happened four billion years ago is a bigger deal and a bunch of water and energy and carbon was like hey i'm gonna be a lie and then depending on how you count and also reality that we haven't uncovered yet somewhere between a few million and a few hundred thousand years ago the universe started to talk to itself about itself it started to be like wow that's pretty and that's us like that's this like this is the universe talking to itself yeah so let's keep an eye on that because there's a reason why we're so worried it's because this is really wonderful so we're protecting something great so that's good a little bit of perspective you don't usually hear when you're talking about multilateral arms treaties but my most important trick here and something that i think we would all benefit a great deal from is talking about the fact that things are hard for reasons like you right now are in the middle of the largest communications revolution in the history of the human race so like yeah we're gonna be bad at it doesn't mean we should resign ourselves to being bad at it doesn't mean we can't be better but like it's not surprising that we're having a hard time i'm getting legitimately worried by the number of people who seem to think we could solve these problems if only humans weren't so awful and stupid and bad i think that idea is seductive i think that it is tremendously disempowering and i think that it is objectively wrong humans do things that were once impossible constantly like the this that we're doing right now was once impossible and in the future we will do many things that are currently impossible i think that getting stuck in disempowerment is the worst place to be for challenging institutions and solving hard problems rage without an outlet is only ever going to make things worse so my remarks i decided to offer an alternative to this once in a while instead of getting mad get curious start with a person or an institution that deeply discusses a big problem that might be the prison policy initiative for incarceration david roberts's volts newsletter and podcast for climate change or fair fight and stacey abrams for voting rights spend some time engaging with those problems on a deeper and deeper and deeper level and even listen to people who disagree with you about those things so you can understand not the most awful radical terrible version of those arguments but the arguments that they're making that are actually convincing people you will realize that these big heart problems are made up of thousands of smaller problems and that each one of those smaller problems has a bunch of people working on them and if each of us is focused on one of those problems we're going to be way more effective than if all of us are focused on all of them and thus not engaging deeply on any of them and that is how i hope i wrote a talk about doomsday that wasn't depressing jon you can see those remarks at a link in the description i will see you on tuesday good morning john so next week a particularly unhinged episode of dear hank and john is going to go up we're just a total mess because we accidentally talked for 90 minutes before the podcast started so we didn't have enough time to record the podcast and i think that the first question that was asked was from avery who asked i was wondering how or if we know that the earth is straight up and down with the northern hemisphere on top of the southern hemisphere on the bottom which led to much hilarity but to continue a discussion that you have not heard yet because the podcast is an hour i want to talk about a time when we humans got something right now every there is no uh it's all arbitrary it's just stuff that we sort of feel and decide for example i live in a river valley where three rivers come together and if you're gonna go into the bedroom valley and you're from missoula you can actually tell something about a person by what they say if they are new to town and don't have a lot of relationship with the land they say that they're going to go down the bitter room whereas if they've been around for a while or they have a deeper connection to the land they say they're going to go up the bitter room this is because when you're going from missoula to the bitterroot valley you are going south but you are also going upstream and uphill the bitterroot river unlike most rivers in america though this is just by coincidence flows from south to north and weirdly this feels a little weird to us even though there's no reason why a river should go in any particular direction like the nile also goes from south to north this confusion implicates as faulty the entire idea of south as down and of course south is very very much not down globes and maps only show north as on top because someone decided that who i don't know but i want to make the very strong case that if they had to choose and i think they did they made get this the right decision things are a mess in this world and we understandably focus a lot on the things that we got wrong for example like that there are 12 months in a year this is terrible if there were 13 months instead of 12 every month would be get this 28 days long except for one which would be 27 days long and 28 days divided by 7 is four so every month would have exactly four weeks in it every month would start on a monday and end on a sunday every holiday would happen on the same day every year and then at the end of the year we'd have one month that was one day short we'd have one week that was one day short and we'd all be like oh this is the cute fun week where we all act weird because there's only six days this is a historical screw-up that we all have to live with forever but maps in the past often would have either west or east at the top and if we had ended up in the universe where we got stuck with this it would have been historically bad because we spin so the actual like location of where west is moves around in space i can even get my head around how hard it would be to conceive of how the earth is if i imagined that west was up like it just breaks me so we absolutely dodged a cosmic bullet here now if it had ended up with south on the top this would not have broken my brain but it would have been a sub-par choice to having north on the top because the southern hemisphere is 80 ocean while the northern hemisphere is just 60 percent ocean so there's twice as much land in the northern hemisphere also 90 percent of the people live in the northern hemisphere now what i'm not saying is that this has no drawbacks there are negative consequences to having settled on north as up on maps for example no one knows whether or not to say up or down the bitter room more importantly we show some unconscious bias toward things in the southern hemisphere and when researchers test people they unconsciously assign more value to places that are further north but also there is huge value in having some kind of standardization here where we all agree that one part of the map is always up and so we don't have to be thinking about it and getting it wrong there were pros and cons to this choice it had negative effects but we made the right call and we ended up avoiding a problem that we never have to think about whereas i always have to think about the fact that we could have lived in a world where halloween was always on a friday night every year john i'll see you on tuesday which is some random day of the month Good morning John, yes you got to record the 15th anniversary video of vlogbrothers but I, and this is a weird coincidence, one day later get to record the 2,000th vlogbrothers video on this channel. And I woke up yesterday to a massive dump of snow which meant that Orin’s school was canceled  So all of my normal plans went right out the window. So what do you get? You get our 2000th video. A compilation of clips I recorded of me talking over it, because I’m gonna be honest, it’s one of the faster ways to make a video. I started out the day making Orin a bagel and then shoveling the walk even though I knew dang well that it wasn’t gonna stop snowing for another 12 hours. Then it was time for Katherine to take over shoveling and I went upstairs to write a couple of really important emails and oh my god is that really what I look like? Then Katherine came in for some recovery time and then it was time for a full hour of Junk Yard Joust, a game where you put hot wheels down a track and they get eliminated if they land on their back of their side. Go ahead and pick which team you think will win. 3 of them will, because Orin doesn’t like it when only one team wins. I put the names of the teams in a pinned comment below. You can reply with the team that you like. This is currently Orin’s #1 favorite way to spend time, cars that get eliminated go in this box. He has a bunch of very specific rules. And then of course we had to watch some actual Junkyard Joust on Youtube. Which is an amazing Youtube channel if you haven’t seen it. It is so fun. And then after that he was sad that we weren’t going to watch any more Youtube videos so he decided to have a  rest underneath this pillow.  I then went for a walk to the coffee shop to get Katherine a latte and listen to the climax of Jade Legacy which is a really amazing book. And yes I did cry while walking down the street. Also on the way I helped push a truck out of the snow. I love a snowy walk. I love a snowy town. I love it when everything slows down a little bit and everyone has to take care of their stuff and take care of each other. I especially love when there is a decaf americano and a croissant at the end of it. Then I had to start writing this script. This is a video of me writing the words I am saying right now, also not tremendously flattering. And then, time for more shoveling. This time I did my neighbor’s walk because he’s out of town and then I had to tweet about how, because of a scheduling mistake we had to push the date of the Project for Awesome back to February 25th which I know is very inconvenient for some people. I’m sorry about this.  We tried to find some other way to fix it but we failed. But yes I am very excited for the Project for Awesome, February 25th. Everybody get ready. I also just uploaded the amazing recap video that Maia edited, and it’s on Hankschannel and you can watch it and remember all the fun times that we had. Then I wrote some more emails and I wrote a tweet about how my pants were wet because of the truck that sprayed snow all over me. Then I recorded a secret video for somebody else that I can’t tell you about right now. And I also wrote a bunch of other stuff that I also can’t really tell you about right now. And look, one of the really fantastic things about vlogbrothers is that we often come to an important point at the end of the video. But often times, we don’t. Sometimes life is just about life. It’s about doing all the things you wanted to do that day, or you needed to do that day. Sometimes it’s about 2,000 videos of content, 15 years of life doing things that I couldn’t imagine because they didn’t exist. And always, always, because a bunch of people working together to keep each other honest and push for really interesting and useful stuff to exist in the world. That stuff existed! And the amazing thing is, I have no idea if I’m halfway through this. Have I made most of the videos I will ever make? I don’t know. Probably. 1,000 videos is a lot of videos. But I don’t know. I’m not looking too hard at it. Because I certainly could not have guessed how the last 15 years would go. What an amazing run! So weird! So much fun! And so many amazing things that would not have been possible without this community or the people who work at Complexly and at Vidcon and at DFTBA. And finally, the moment you have been waiting for: here are your Junkyard Joust winners. Congratulations to the white team, the green team, and the batmobiles. John, thank you and I will see you on Tuesday. good morning john now i would not normally release a video on christmas eve but a bunch of people who have been working for decades one of the most exciting scientific instruments ever built are going to be releasing that into space on christmas day so i could not help myself i made a video about the james webb space telescope and how amazing it is going to be on this channel 10 years ago and now it is headed to space this is an endeavor to help answer real deep human questions some of the biggest ones like how do planets form is there life elsewhere in the universe and how does the universe work you can't do what the jwst wants to do from the ground and to understand why you have to remember that light is made up of lots of different frequencies we can only see with our eyes a really narrow band of those frequencies but the web wants to see specifically in infrared for several different reasons the big one being that the universe is expanding and so things that happened a long time ago and are very far away their light has actually been stretched by the expansion of the universe and it's been stretched into the infrared but there's a problem with this which is that infrared radiation comes off of anything that has heat and basically everything has heat but the exceptional reality of the web is that at the tiny dim levels of light they want to measure from exoplanets or the beginning of the universe if the telescope itself is warm at all the mirrors will radiate infrared light that would overwhelm the observations so the telescope has to be extremely cold so you need to block out all sources of heat particularly the sun but also the earth and the moon which shoot off enough infrared radiation to heat up the telescope too much so the telescope has to have a heat shield that can block off of that heat but it needs all of those sources of heat to be in the same direction so the heat shield can block all of them at the same time luckily there is a gravitationally stable point on the opposite side of the sun earth system and that is where the web will orbit keeping its solar panels and sunshield pointed toward the earth and the sun while on the other side the telescope thanks to its five giant heat shields will be cold enough to liquefy air the launch and deployment of the jwst is going to be extremely tense it's scheduled right now for christmas morning 7 20 eastern time and that launch is gonna be tense but it will not be the end of the tension so just so you know what we're in for in the path to making these tremendously valuable observations here are the biggest size of relief that we are going to experience over the next month the first one will come about 33 minutes after launch when these solar panels will automatically deploy because that means we are in space and the craft can power itself 12 hours after launch we have the first burn now remember the web cannot be refueled it has all the propellant it will ever have so depending on how accurate the initial launch was this course correction could use more or less fuel and using less could potentially add years to the mission so another big reason to worry right here three days after launch you start the five day long process that is to me the scariest the deployment of the sun shield each of these tennis court sized sheets are thinner than a human hair everything has to go right it has been tested and it all should the temperature difference between one side of these sheets and the other side is 600 degrees fahrenheit and finally the biggest weight comes off of everyone's chest 13 days after launch when the mirrors and some other important bits of the telescope have been fully deployed and it will be ready to be a telescope and the final sigh of relief happens 29 days after launch when the telescope will be at a stable orbit at l2 at which point the web will have been successfully deployed and the team will spend a further four to five months calibrating and testing the telescope before five to six months after launch we received the first ever images from the james webb space telescope john i don't know what the point of being a human is but i know that somewhere close to the root is curiosity we want to make the world better for ourselves and for other people but even without that concern i think we want to know we want to learn we want to look really deep into ourselves into our world and into our universe and in a very literal way we are about to see deeper than we ever have before the jwst launch is scheduled for christmas morning 7 20 am eastern time john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i've been a person who professionally talks about science for years now it's a wonderful job and i love almost every question i get there are two kinds of questions that i don't love to get one is one that i've answered a bunch of times before and i'm like all right somebody else handle this one second is questions that seem like they should just be very easy to answer but they aren't and they're just they sit there and i don't answer them and i'm like why is this so hard and no question in this second category is more common than the title of this video what state of matter is fire if you ask this question to google you get all wrong answers why are we doing this to ourselves what is so hard here well we are doing this to ourselves because it is very very very not simple now matter really does mostly exist in a few discrete states and that's literally because of how the atoms and molecules are interacting with each other but i think what mostly sticks with us uh isn't like thinking about in terms of particles it's just sort of the the qualities so a solid keeps its shape a liquid keeps its volume but its shape can change and then a gas its volume and shape can change and if you just take that and you put it on fire you're like well none of that's true so let me instead answer this question with a question what state of matter is a waterfall now you're going to think to yourself hank that's a liquid but no the water in the water follows a liquid but the waterfall is not matter it is a process caused by a bunch of liquid and gas and solids in a specific situation a waterfall does not have a state of matter because a waterfall isn't matter it's a process now you can look at it and you can say that cliff is made of rock and the water is a liquid and the air that's sort of tossing up those beautiful water droplets that's a gas so i can kind of answer the question what state of matter is a waterfall it's a bunch of different states of matter and so the natural thing to do is to do this with fire just label the constituents and this is why fire is harder than a waterfall because the molecules in a fire unlike the molecules in a waterfall are undergoing rapid chemical reactions and while those chemicals are still made of matter they are reacting they do not have a state of matter because their electrons are jumping from atom to atom molecules are rearranging and in the space between one chemical and another we don't really know what things are because we can't put them in bottles we can however stop them i'm gonna do that for you right now i'm gonna i'm gonna pause the chemical reaction while it is going off if i pass my spoon through my fire what i get is soot and this is why a lot of people say that the state of matter of fire is a solid what is happening in this fire is that wax is evaporating and then it is combusting it's burning in the process of that combustion lots of different weird chemicals are formed and they are all turned into these little tiny particles that in the flame while they are undergoing chemical reactions glow with their own heat as they continue through the flame they continue to react and at the end of this process you don't have that solid anymore but in there most of what you see as the fire is solid pieces of soot glowing but there's also a component of the flame the blue part to be exact that is not caused by soot particles glowing this is excited atoms of gas emitting light as well but also because there's so many reactions happening so quickly in combustion a lot of the matter in a flame isn't behaving like how we think matter behaves because it's in the midst of a chemical reaction so those atoms and electrons and ions and molecules and in-betweeny molecules they kind of aren't any state of matter and maybe we will understand all of that better someday but really it's just a place where these usually quite hard lines between things kind of breaks down for me though there's a real answer here that's all much simpler than this fire does not have a state of matter because fire is not matter fire is a process john i'll see you on wednesday to wednesday tuesday by the way this used project for awesome calendar is now available we do it a little before the project for awesome so you can actually have it this year's calendar celebrates a lot of the history of nerdfighteria with different images from kind of different eras of this wonderful bizarre thing that also is very difficult to describe good morning john one of the weird things about being on tick tock is that because the group of people there is literally just different people oftentimes younger people there are sometimes conversations i see being had that i have had like pretty much everybody i know is done with that conversation but they haven't had it yet so they're having to have it this happened recently when i saw a tick tock uh arguing whether to say jiff or gif and and i am at least five years into having heard everything you can say about that and having settled upon both are correct so i did actually get a little bit pissed off when i heard again the well it's not giraffix interchange format it's graphics interchange format so it must be gif that's not how acronyms work i don't care how you pronounce gif but i do care if your argument is garbage but this is not the point that i want to make my point is that there are some things that definitely don't matter we know they don't matter but they're jarring when we come across people doing them differently like when i see a screenshot of light mode twitter i'm like what what are you thinking smiley face without noses i don't like it other people don't like me doing smiley faces with noses cowboy bebop subtitled versus dubbed at england now look i'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons why these things are different like the experience of subtitled cowboy bebop is different from the experience of english dub gif makes sense because if you put a t on it it's gif jif makes sense because that's what the developer of the format called it taking the toilet paper off the front makes it a little bit easier to take off having it on the back makes it so that your cat can't like do this and just have it all come on i'm not saying there aren't differences here what i'm saying is that the way that i do it is the way that i think everybody should do it and i'm gonna come up with reasons why that's better people can argue all day about whether subtitled or dubbed cowboy bebop is better but the one that they like is the one that they watched first light mode twitter looks normal if that's what you're used to using dark mode looks normal if that's what you're used to using the thing that's bugging us it's not all these rationalizations it's just the fact that it's different and i'm not saying that we're bad because we're irrational i'm just saying that we're irrational and the fact that things this simple that do not affect our lives at all can make our brains go oh no something is wrong i don't like it i think it shows like how hard it is to do society how are we as a species supposed to get anything done when things that don't even matter cause these little mini protests in our brains i can't watch english dubbed cowboy bebop even though i know that it is very good and that many people make the case that it is objectively better than the original version i can't do it it's like fingernails on a chalkboard it's like i know that i'm being and i know that i'm being irrational i don't want you to think that like this is me being a hipster no i know that it's stupid and i will never say gif i will never say gif i just won't when i think about it this way it is absolutely amazing that we get anything done at all things that actually matter are so hard just on their own but then you've got like also to include all these little irrational biases that we have and are going to have and can't get rid of we are really deeply controlled by wanting things to be the way that we expect them to be whether that is like how the economy works or whether a smiley has a nose but that stuff is never going to be universal because the world is complicated and varied and weird and it should be weird i like it because it's weird here's a definitely true thing no two people have ever agreed on everything ever and yet we have managed to get quite a lot done which gives me hope that in the future despite all of this we will continue to get stuff done john i'll see you on tuesday john it's the next day and it's the first time in ages that i have ended a vlogbrothers video and had time like this is shocking i don't know what to do i guess what i'll do is to remind everybody to go watch your video from last week which was really lovely and thoughtful and beautiful and i was very touched by it thank and and i'm gonna thank everybody for joining the awesome socks club look if you're a current member you get these cool froggy ones but if you just joined your first sock will come in january good morning john is how we start these videos you don't like throw that in a couple of sentences into the video and expect to not hear about it anyway there's a pretty big problem that i think i have come up with a good solution to you know how when you put your foot inside of a shoe it doesn't feel great it can be like bumpy in there and a little rough and like the foot sweat builds up i have invented a product that goes between your foot and your shoe it's like a kind of foot sleeve it's stretchy in cotton and you pull it up on over your foot before you put your shoe on and then boom it cushions your foot it absorbs the foot sweat and you can even wear them without shoes just to keep your feet warm around the house now this is a really new idea but i think there's a chance that it could really catch on which brings up something that i've been wanting to talk about for a while when you or i have an idea like something that we would like to bring into the world we're not entirely in control of what that idea needs to look like no individual humans are in charge what is in charge is a set of values and expectations that this community shares when appealing ideas mesh with those values amazing things can and have happened and that's a really big part of like what we do here because i think that foot sleeves could be a really big deal but you can't just do foot sleeves the normal way if it's going to be a project from this community you have to do it in some way that is exceptional and finds ways to be in concert with the values let's say for example that it's a subscription where you can sign up and get foot sleeves in your mail every month each one designed by a different independent artist and also instead of being open all the time with all of the inventory problems and excess waste that that can create it's only open during very limited windows and also because this community is much more interested in solving long-term problems than it is in short-term profit you donate all of the profit to help build more robust healthcare systems and impoverished communities so now it is time for me to abandon the conceit that i uh invented socks especially because this will be the second year of the awesome socks globby sock subscription for charity that this community has helped energize and activate with its values and its goals and its mission so much so that it has allowed it to grow outside of this community and we project that we're going to donate over 900 000 to charity this year and also because the yearly opening of the sock club starts today and it goes only for the next nine days if you click on the link in the description you can sign up to get a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist delivered to you every month shipping is free and you can cancel any time and yes every dollar of profit goes to support our community's work decreasing maternal and child mortality in sierra leone there is one thing that has changed in our second year last year we set it up as a one-year subscription six months in we discovered that the majority of people thought that it was a perpetual subscription so if you are an early adopter to the sock club you will need to renew if you want to keep getting your socks uh starting on january of 2022. to do that just go into your email and search for an email that i sent you just search hank green in your inbox if you don't have that email you don't need to do anything moving forward the awesome socks club is perpetual but you can still cancel any time just to avoid that confusion but you can also get a gift subscription if you want a subscription that will automatically cancel after 12 months imagine how revolutionary an idea socks would be if they had not been invented yet we would be so excited about that but this community did not invent socks what it did do is with its values and with its activation and excitement it invented like a new way to do socks instead of the way where you have to think too much about it and stand around awkwardly in the target underwear section and then it being not that cool looking anyway and all the profit goes to some stranger you let the experts take care of it with a delightful surprise delivered to you once a month and 100 compostable packaging and yes all of the profit goes to make the world a better place just out here solving problems the nerdfighter way there's a link in the description john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john in the year 2000 juan and pedro sanchez two brothers in mexico were drilling down in a mine that like a lead in silver mine it was hot down there like 130 degrees fahrenheit it was i imagine unpleasant and dangerous work and mines are always contending with a lot of different hazards one of them though is water because mines are underground and water goes down people and equipment both work best when they are not submerged in 130 degree water so mines almost always have huge pumps that remove a tremendous amount of water from the ground so that people and machines can work down there well in this mine in mexico something magnificent had been uncovered by those pumps with that water taken out those brothers drilled down into a giant cave full of some of the largest crystals ever discovered on earth now an important thing to know you cannot go visit these crystals one because the mine has since stopped pumping the water out and so that cavern is now full of water again but maybe more importantly the scientists who did get a chance to go down into this cave they had to wear some very special suits and those suits were designed to do two things one keep them cool because not only is it 130 degrees fahrenheit that's 55 celsius it was also extremely humid because like there's a lot of water down there and all that water was evaporating into that very hot air and so it was like 90 to 99 humidity in there which meant that the water that you sweat can't evaporate from your skin into the air there's no room left in the air for more water so you have no system for cooling yourself off and you would overheat and die and more terrifyingly they also had to wear basically scuba equipment they had to breathe air that they carried around with them but why because the air down there isn't poisonous there's not like some weird alien spores that are going to infect their lungs it turns out that 130 degree air can hold a lot of water right so 100 humidity with 130 degree air that's a lot of water in the air and when you bring the temperature of air down it can hold less water so that water condenses out that's why lots of water vapor going up into the atmosphere condenses into clouds when it reaches higher colder areas of the atmosphere yes that's where clouds come from also why a glass a cold iced tea has water conducting on the side of it because the the air hits the side of that glass cools down and the water falls out when it's 130 degrees and 100 humidity outside you know what's cooler than the air the inside of your lungs so if you didn't have a tank of air on your back every breath you would take in this cave would condense a little bit more water in your lungs a little more a little more until you drown now this did not happen to anyone they knew that it was a thing and so they were able to plan around it but still that's why this is a really really really cool planet but in a sense like we kind of never should have seen that cave and now that the mine is no longer pumping the water out we can't see it anymore it's just down there and we had this very narrow slice of like five years during which we could examine and study these giant crystals we only got to see those crystals because of a truly bizarre series of coincidences this reminds me of how in rome they've spent 40 years trying to build a single subway line but every time they dig they find some other like truly irreplaceable remarkable archaeological site there's just so much that remains hidden from us i told katherine about these crystal caves and she like exclaimed on our walk home the earth is an alien planet which is just such a good line because of course like there is nothing less alien than the planet that we evolved to exist on that we as a species have barely ever left that sustains us every day but also it is right even after all of this inquiry it remains full of the unknown and it's so inhospitable to us in everywhere except the very narrow slice just at the surface and yet as we continue to prove over and over again these unknowns are knowable and i know that this doesn't make any like philosophical sense but making those unknowns known whether they are about avocados and megafauna or giant crystal caves it just seems like a very good use of time john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john about 12 000 years ago some people started to get really good at controlling the plants that made their food they would take care of them they'd move them around and water them and remove their competition and they started to plant seeds from the plants that were just a little bit better they were a little easier to take care of they made some more food they tasted a little bit better that kind of thing choosing something that was a little bit better and then a little bit better than a little bit better it made things a lot better over the long term this is one of my favorite examples uh that's just the tip of some grass that you're looking at right now and that we selected into this giant hunk and crunch of sweetness this is usually called artificial selection but i think that might be a term that we eventually move past because like we're not fake we're just human but also because the term artificial selection makes a little less sense when you notice that there are cases of unintentional evolution through human selection let's talk about it one of the ways we take care of crops is we eliminate their competition we pull up weeds but you can't ever pull up all of the weeds and you are least likely to pull up the weeds that look a little bit like your crop because you don't want to pull up your crop and so the weeds that looked the most like their crops were most likely to get left and then their offspring would look more like the crop and the ones that looked the most like the crop would be most likely to procreate you see where we're going here eventually you end up with a weed that looks almost entirely like your crop plants that do this are called vavalovian mimics named after the guy who first figured this all out and valvolovian mimics remain to this day a problem as an example camelina sativa is a plant that is also sometimes called false flax kind of impractical to separate them out in the field so we ended up separating out the seeds making sure we only planted flaxseed in the field we created big machines and a lot of infrastructure to do this and you know what happened we created a new evolutionary pressure to have false flax seeds look and act to that machine exactly like flax seed so now the machines can't tell false flax seeds from flax seeds what a gigantic pain in the butt john i sometimes worry that we look at our world and we only see the problems it makes sense that we would do this if you're a flax farmer you have to think about false flax a lot but false flax is a problem that was created by a solution that solution being agriculture and agriculture safe to say has created a lot of problems but it's also solved a lot of problems including probably the biggest problem an individual human can have which is the i don't want to watch my child starve problem solving problems creates new problems like the last hundred years of remarkable increases in quality of life and increases in the value we place on human lives would not have been possible without coal and oil and gas and those fuels created a huge number of problems some of which we solved some of which are going to require us to stop using them in order to solve global warming is not a problem that was created by evil it's a problem that was created by people solving problems i was listening to the ezra klein show a couple weeks ago and maggie nelson said uh something that i don't know if i've ever heard a more true thing said more beautifully she said that people right now have a deep hunger for a tool with no blood on it and i do i do but i don't know that that exists i don't know that it can exist the world is messy and we need to stop thinking that we can survive in it without doing any harm we need to find ways to mitigate the harm and ways to solve the problems we also need to understand that the solutions to those problems will create yet more problems the internet is an amazing solution that has created a lot of problems i wanted it to be a tool with no blood on it it is not but the human experiment that we are all a part of is not an attempt to arrive at perfect it has always been and will always be an attempt to select for a world that is just a little bit better than it was before john i'll see you on tuesday p.s john cause i know you weren't gonna let me get away with this my cat's name is gummy bear which is the decision that oren made and it's a cute name because it's like cute and bouncy but also secretly i like it because a good nickname for a cat named gummy bear remains goburker which i do still sometimes call him bit of a heavy video to end with a cat name but look the human experience is varied and and and we celebrate that stay tuned to the end of the video to find out what's in the bag good morning john it is friday my final day of pizza miss the final day of pizzamas as usual it has gone by far too fast and i have ended pizza mix with more video ideas that i started it with so i don't i guess i could just do this which makes sense because in 2007 i did we did this this is what this was every week so i guess i understand how we did it back then but i don't really understand how we're still doing this now there's something confusing but also really lovely about doing a thing that isn't a thing i think a lot in the visual metaphor of paths a path is nice because like people have been on it and so you can see ahead you know where you're going and you know where you're going to end up i think it's safe to say that this community is off of most of the well-trod pads so sometimes it feels like we can't see very far ahead and i can guarantee you we don't know where we're going i hope people don't think we have a destination in mind we don't but it's exciting off the path high chances of tripping and falling absolutely occasionally uncomfortable sure chances of ending up somewhere you didn't expect very high the exceptional storyteller and video maker johnny harris left a comment on my last pizza miss video i've been a die-hard fan of this channel for one decade now but i still don't understand what pizza miss is and i kind of love that me too and i love it so much like every year i kind of know what pizza miss is a little less which is perfect it's confusing but it's low stakes and it's lovely what is pizzamis what is vlogbrothers what is nerdfighteria like i feel a little like i'm bragging right now but like is not fitting into any of the boxes that have been defined well i'm sorry it's just this isn't what your normal youtube community looks and acts like which is great it makes it hard to talk about sometimes which can be bad but also it makes it so that we continue to be under the radar which i like let's stay down here anyway it used to be that pizzamas was like extra work for me now it's less work because i don't do the rest of my work and it just becomes a time when i get to be creative all the time it's like a creative vacation where instead of working on work i work on a different kind of work that isn't working i mean it can be hard work like i worked very hard on that facebook video there was a lot of sitting and staring and researching and writing and editing and editing and editing and forgetting about lunch and etc but even after all these years making a vlogbrothers video never feels like going to work like the goal isn't productivity it's just making things and seeing if people like them which maybe is part of why we started donating all the profit from pizza mess like it helps it not feel like work if we're not making money speaking of which at the beginning of pizza miss we thought we were going to do some discount codes throughout pizza mess that we said that we were to the people who aren't going to get text messages but then we felt bad about it because we were like felt like punishing the people who bought early that was mean so we decided not to do that but we also said we were going to so as a middle road let me present to you the coupon code nickelback which will give you five cents off of any order at pizzamist.com and if you don't like that idea it was john's idea if you do like it it was also john's idea i'm just the one who clicked the buttons to make it happen and if you're doing gift shopping right now i think the only other vlogbrothers thing we're doing before the end of the year is the relaunch of the awesome socks club just so you know what's going on in our commerce schedule and finally i would like to introduce you to my cat its name has not been decided yet it turns out it's difficult to choose a name when a four-year-old is involved so at the moment everyone this is kitty he has tried on a lot of different names they all fit him differently but we have not settled on a name yet but regardless already i love him so much he's so cute and no you don't get to vote on the name that's up to oren thank you all so much for a wonderful pizza miss the pizzamas store will remain open through the weekend but this is the last time that i will be telling you on a video that pizzamist.com is a place where you can get pizza in this stuff five cents off with the coupon nickelback all profit goes to charity and none of these items will ever be available ever again after this sunday and john i will see you on tuesday good morning john going pizza john classic today so we're all in agreement that speed is relative and you say that you ran those 17 miles slowly but just so you know to me and probably many of the people watching this any speed at all after running 16 miles is effectively infinite i have not in my entire life of 41 years run more than one mile at a time like if you add all of my running up i bet you get above 17. john the fact that you've put together some system of willpower great enough to keep you exercising and and gaining all of the physical and mental benefits that come along with that honestly it's kind of inspirational like that's not something i've been able to do but i feel like you make me feel like i could do it honestly bro you are a pretty inspirational guy a thing i was reminded of when i listened to the most recent episode of heavyweight a podcast it was titled john you are the john in question which is a little weird i can't believe that after 15 years of telling stories on the internet you still had that story it made me think a lot about how big our world is and how no one has the capacity to care about everything um and that's okay everything is a lot of things and you can quote me on that john i have a friend who just got sick with covet and she's fine she's vaccinated she's young she's gonna be okay but of course she feels like absolute garbage and also she told me that she feels really frustrated like all of the last two years of being careful were for nothing because she's still got covet a frustration that i understand but and i didn't say this to her it's just a thing that it made me think along with the podcast episode we haven't spent the last two years wearing masks and enduring lockdowns and being careful in order to eliminate the possibility of getting covet as an individual like maybe at one point that's what we thought we were doing but we can't eliminate the possibility completely it's always gonna be there we are lowering the probability that any individual person will get it because that slows down the spread overall everyone's got lower odds but some people are gonna get unlucky and it is probably true that if she hadn't done any of this stuff she would have got kovit the same number of times but even leaving behind the fact that one she's vaccinated now so it's gonna be less severe and two like maybe she would have gotten covered multiple times because that can happen the real point is that we think of ourselves as individuals but the world acts on us as a collective think of it like voting in a big election like i am under no illusions that my one vote in a red state with three electoral votes was going to have an impact on the presidential election but i still did it because everybody thinks well my one vote won't matter then no one votes and that's not a very good democracy so why this anecdote in the middle of this video well because you've been caring about a person for years who you would have had no connection with if not for a very peculiar specific moment in your life and there's so many other people like that but it's not on any individual to care about everything or to do everything to never get covered to launch a space telescope to decrease maternal mortality in sierra leone to teach every student or plumb every house treat every patient deliver every package plant every tree or cook every meal we do all of these things in a web of care and if all of us extend our care out a little bit more yeah that does make the web catch more things we don't need to care about everything because everything is too many things and i don't need to care about everything because that's actually a kind of selfish thought that's what other people are for like regardless of your wonderful lovely depth of care for the person in your story whether that was there or not he was cared for and that seems wrong to me but it is not wrong like don't people need my care specifically but no usually they don't even saying the words as i have done several times i don't need to care about everything makes me feel gross like it is a it sounds callous but i'm not saying that the things that i don't focus on in my everyday practice aren't worthy of care i'm saying that they don't need my care i can and need to trust my fellow members of the web to do their care i have to because it is a good thing that we don't have to care about everything not least because we can't john i'll see you tomorrow good morning john it's monday and pizzamas is going by very quickly so quickly that it is reminding me of a video that i've wanted to do for a very long time because i'm fascinated by what happens when you ask seemingly simple questions like for example what's the fastest thing sounds like that would be really objective and that you could just answer it and be done with it like the answer is light light is the fastest thing but is light a thing it's not matter it doesn't have mass i can't like grab it also in some cases particles can go faster than light as long as the light isn't traveling through a vacuum so yeah the interesting thing to me is that i think a bunch of different people could have this same title for a video and make very different videos but here's the video that i would make here are the top four six i don't know things that are the fastest let's start out with the fastest a person has ever gone now for a long time that was just running and then it was horses and actually i have bad news it was neither of those things for a long time the fastest person was someone who did not survive because they were falling off of something very high up the terminal velocity of a human body in our atmosphere is 120 miles per hour you can easily reach that if you fall off just you know a number of different waterfalls and the 120 miles per hour that somebody probably experienced while falling off of a waterfall or a cliff somewhere was not exceeded until the 1900s specifically probably in the 1910s or 1920s we're not entirely sure because cars were very new and people were driving them very fast and we didn't have great ways to measure how fast they were going anyway people were definitely going over 120 miles per hour by the 1920s and then over the next few decades we very rapidly increased our top speed until the 60s when we had gone from 120 miles per hour to over 24 000. and that record set in the 1960s by three people at the same time has not yet been beaten and we are not on the way to beating it the three people in question were tom stafford john young and eugene cernan and they were on the way home from the moon they did not land on because this was apollo 10. it went faster on the way back to earth than any other apollo mission i don't think because they were like in a hurry to get home i'm guessing it was just because of like orbital mechanics reasons but yeah that's the fastest a person has ever gone and we're not looking to exceed it until probably we head to mars but we have made lots of things that have gone way faster than apollo 10. but here's the thing that's pretty easy to understand as an orbit gets lower it gets faster so mercury orbits the sun faster than venus which orbits faster than earth which orbits faster than mars and so if you want to get a probe really close to the sun to do science on the sun it's going to be going very fast during the part of its orbit when it's close to the sun and that brings us to the parker solar probe which this year broke its own record for the fastest a man-made object has ever gone with around 330 000 miles per hour now very strangely this might not be the fastest a man-made object has ever gone if you remember my 2017 wheezy waiter paternity leave video you'll know about this but it might be that the fastest man-made object ever was the manhole cover that capped an underground nuclear test that went slightly awry the shock of the explosion was vented improperly and so it all went to this one manhole cover which was then of course blasted off there was a high-speed camera running and the manhole cover appears in one frame of the high-speed film that allowed scientists to calculate that at minimum it was going 125 000 miles per hour and there wasn't enough data to put a maximum on that so it could have been going significantly faster than that that manhole cover may have been blasted into space where it would still be or it may have vaporized as it slammed through the atmosphere either way it did not fall back to earth and that brings us to the final question all right so those are the fastest things that we've made what's just the fastest thing hank what's the fastest thing and if we're not counting a light in a vacuum because of course that is the fastest thing the fastest stuff that has mass well that would be like the superheated jets of plasma that come off of active galactic nucleuses so supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies called blazars blazars shoot big globs of this plasma out some of them like as big as the planet jupiter going over 99 the speed of light why does this happen i have no idea and then here at the end a quick note speed is a function of distance and time and time it turns out is relative and so speed itself kind of doesn't exist but pizzamas does and it's going fast and you can go to petesmith.com right now to see all of the amazing products that we have available now that will never be available after the end of this week john i'll see you tomorrow the fastest thing in the world Good morning John. So I was on Tiktok a couple of days ago, and let’s be honest all ofthe other days a well. But on that particular day"}
