{ "data": "good morning John in August of 2019 the New York Times published an article that was titled why hate speech on the Internet is a never-ending problem because this law Shields the law in question was section 230 of the communications decency act later that day they published The Following retraction an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the law that protects hate speech on the internet the First Amendment not section 230 of the communications decency act protects it now this is kind of funny it's also kind of not especially if you know the long history of people misunderstanding section 230 and what it means it is very difficult for all of us to figure out how to adjust to the power that the internet wields and when we're doing that it's pretty easy to look toward what's probably the most important piece of legislation in the history of the internet which was passed as part of a much larger bill when Mark Zuckerberg was 11 years old and then when he was 12 years old almost all of that law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court but they left one section section 230 which says among other things this no provider or user of an interactive Computer Service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider to explain right now I am the other information content provider and YouTube is the provider of the interactive Computer Service and so if I slander someone or try to recruit someone to my terrorist cell or otherwise do something illegal you can sue or find or imprison me you can't hold YouTube liable for what I said this thing section 230 is kind of what made it possible for the many to many internet thing to exist which is good but also bad it's the thing that we love about the internet and it's the thing that we hate about the internet right now the Supreme Court is hearing a case against YouTube that argues that YouTube is not liable for the content in the videos on its platform but it is liable for the recommendations of that content to people if the YouTube algorithm recommends terrorist recruitment videos to YouTube users it isn't just hosting content it's also kind of creating a new kind of content which is the recommendation and that seems a little bit right to me the problem though is where do you draw the line for what counts as a recommendation is a Google search a list of recommendations that Google is making to me does that mean that every internet platform that has a recommendation system of any kind meaning all of them are they liable for what they recommended if they are does the internet work at all it looks like the Supreme Court will not find YouTube liable in this case which I think is good but the reality is that there is something of a difference between the front page of YouTube being algorithmically generated for each individual user and me searching for something and getting recommended results and maybe there's a difference between those two things and chat GPT creating content that I will then read that was nonetheless created by a machine there's definitely a way to see recommendation as creation I just don't think that a law passed in 1996 did a good job of anticipating that and actually I think that that law had a tremendous amount of foresight and has served us fairly well there was a moment when the Supreme Court was talking about this when Justice Kagan said something that I want to play for you now you know every other industry has to internalize the costs of misconduct why is it that the tech industry gets a pass on the other hand I mean we're a court we really don't know about these things you know these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet the implication being we probably shouldn't be trying to figure this stuff out based on 26 words that were written in 1996. it should be decided by passing new legislation that considers the internet as it exists now which is pretty different from when there are interactive Computer Services I think that we're actually pretty dang lucky that section 230 supported the creation of this new tool of many-to-many communication which has I admit drawbacks but I don't think anybody's figured out like a good and simple way to tease all the bad parts out from the good parts and the times that we've attempted to do that haven't had great outcomes it's very hard to legislate for a world that changes this quickly so if it feels sometimes like we don't know how to do this it's because we don't know how to do it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John and welcome to the project for awesome 2023 meme review during the project for awesome people make things and then they submit them to the project for awesome art folder including this music that you're hearing right now from ickle there was a whole album of techno vlogbrother stuff I'm still pretty hyped for awesome and the two cups of black tea that I just had five count them five folders on my desktop that I have filled with stuff relying on the fact that I have two years in a row gotten permission to make extra long videos I'm gonna do that starting of course since it's a meme review with the folder labeled memes just like the project for awesome there is no Rhyme or Reason to this you just start somewhere in the middle and you put the peeps in the bean can and add the Dr Pepper all these powerful white men are are laughing at John Green because they put the Dr Pepper on Peeps and at that point you have to do it I don't know if I've said this before but I actually wrapped like gift wrapped the peeps and it said project for awesome day one open on day one and then my son thought it was a present for him and he opened it at John house and just started eating them sound financial decisions and me being held back by sending two middle-aged guys to a restaurant it's twenty dollars and we are gonna make it worth it everywhere I go I see his face look I'm not necessarily proud I did buy way too many oh geez I just spilled pickle juice on myself it wasn't totally sealed well I do still have my paper towels because it's project for awesome and the most important thing is paper look at how many paper towels I used let's just all take a moment to be grateful for Catherine green anyway I bought too many pickles as all I wanted to say just putting beans in the bean home I've got a bean shirt on and a banana Loca in one hand and a corn dog in the other any cylindrical food is on the table I did buy hot dogs this year and I didn't end up using them next year project for awesome audience just watching me slapping Dr Pepper baked beads on an unsuspecting pickle Hank Green slurping Dr Pepper beans from a banana Loca doesn't exist and can't hurt you oh yeah you think so and I had to get them out somehow I don't know I feel like everyone was having a good time and I stand by the fact that a Twinkie filled with Dr Pepper baked beans is better than a Twinkie knot filled with Dr Pepper baked beans this is in reference to the auction that we had for Ryan Reynolds Deadpool screen worn watch me and Ray were in a tight battle and then Ben came out of the last second Chow this is great because it does look like he's joking but he is not joking Dustin was responsible for the largest single hour of the project for awesome this year support the project for Awesome by watching the live stream by voting on videos by donating by getting married and moving to North Dakota that's a deep cut but that was a fun part of the stream guests are ready signal strong donation steady made a donation to the project already Hank's confetti if you got the confetti perk I've ordered some special stickers to close these up with I'm just waiting on that and then they'll go out to you me before crabilis me after I get a premium subscription to have a crab in my inbox every month I love this because I know the screen cap that this video is from because Oren and I watch it together all the time and we dance Captain Crunch Gotta Love any amount of Darcy that gets into the memes me and John on both crunched a lemon and it was bad both times crunch uh looking at Darcy crunching a carrot instead of me crunching a lemon and look I don't know I feel like I put more into that than Darcy did you can't defeat me humans I know but she can that's right Darcy crunching carrots was responsible for us breaking through the two million dollar barrier this wasn't like the first moments of the project for awesome where I was like I guess it's begun I'm gonna make a hole in the bottom of a peep that's Dr Pepper flavor and filled with beans we didn't have to hit a goal to get there or anything I just couldn't stop myself and I don't know that John liked it for every ten thousand dollars we will reward Darcy with carrots Nerdfighters Max Max Max so his spaceship is very good friendship ended with beans now hummus is my best friend we that was the first mention of hummus of this whole meme review I don't know if anybody was happy to see the banana Loca come back weirdly I now have two because I was gifted one by a friend who didn't know I had one who knew that I would want one so I'm like this in real life I a little bit like the part where you don't like it like you have to know that right I tried to Crunch a carrot as good as Darcy I don't actually think I did I think I did a worse job so the story behind the hummus is that it turns out one of the stock notification sounds in slack is just a woman saying a hummus I changed it because people donated for me to change it and I left it that way for the entire project for rasa but I did mute the more active slack channels and before I did that there was a lot of hummus happening it was a little overwhelmed yeah like this and like that and like that doing 20 on something I need spending twenty dollars so two guys can go to a racks I don't know if you needed that but I think that we all needed that yeah they knew ultimately it is a little hard for it not to be a problem tummy time the project for awesome but we work through it I'm gonna donate for a perk that is so being filled you don't actually get any Bean filled perks that's not that's not available yet maybe next year adding a citrus crunching a almond I don't know if it was supposed to be lemon but it says Ramen and that's great never ask a woman her age a man his salary Hank wear the slip of paper from the balloon win I never found it maybe it's like in one of these cracks or it like flew into the bookshelf somewhere I never found it someday I will we had to vote on who the mascot of the 2023 project for awesome lesson T-Rex clobbered hummus Lemon Lips man was the other option uh it wasn't even close this is great because the meme is referencing itself fantastic work John cannot be quiet about tuberculosis at the moment but God bless him for it John I love you for who you are oh yeah when I crunch the limb and my lips swelled up and I looked like this guy from Monsters Inc also last year I had to pretend to be a crab this year I had to pretend to be a cute little housefly and both times it definitely hurt my knees I did decide that the phone a friend task was too easy so I taped my phone to my phone which also might be part of the reason why my knee hurts this is part of the story of this year's project for awesome we decide like we had to commit the bit we had to make it a priority it's been too long we've talked about racks and not been to a racks we're gonna go to Rex which might be a problem for our pants but we're gonna do it anyway are we gonna talk about why Rax is bad for your pants it's very deep it's too deep it's time to go was I a good restaurant no you ruined pants I don't even really know where it came from this is great because it's destined on the moon and he's Mr T which is tuberculosis racks T-Rex is as well hello the moon you can eat here it's everything it's got everything all at once marked safe from beans on a peeps you're not you're never safe the two Vibes of the project for awesome are a little bit contradictory but I think they come together very well someone accidentally bid 42 000 for the watch and we had to roll it back but luckily we were able to do that stay up to date on your vaccinations the internet's hottest club is the p4a live stream this place has everything Bean filled pickles the word hummus fast food restaurant chain rack honestly that list could have gone on way longer and not gotten any less weird big Lemon Lips a Furby made of beans and dinosaurs going to the Moon if you don't know about Stefan this doesn't make sense but that's okay who would win famous science educator or a puzzle of electric rap the puzzle of the electric rat one I actually found the piece that I couldn't find after the stream ending you think you're gonna get beans no you mostly get slack hummus and beans though baked beans no lemons no lemon baked beans I put a little bit of lemon juice in the Dr Pepper baked beans and it was way it was so good it was way better it needed something to cut that sugar is there a world where I could give Paul Hollywood a pickle stuffed with baked beans because I feel like that would be an achievement Destin kept saying tataria which I understand it looks like tataria now that I'm looking at it to ataria is how it's pronounced I like that spaceship that's a nice spaceship sorry you're memeing the concept of hummus and it was a good mascot maybe just not the best they are both the p4re I cannot disagree Hey look it's the part where I had my phone taped to my foot and I called my friend Joe just drowning in hummus I couldn't make it out who would win one Hank Green or one lemon boy one lemon boy would win oh no was I just whining about my knee the whole time I'm sure I was and that's the end that's the end of the memes everybody time to move on to the next folder none of them are going to be anywhere as long as the memes but we do have one folder that's just called hummus this almost ended up in the art folder because it's beautiful oh my God it's hummus hummus Hank trying to raise money for charity the trains coming by it says Hamas listening for hummus by Hank Green special 16th anniversary edition number one inside joke for nerdfighteria of project for awesome 2023 evocative hummus meme Iraq's being dipped into hummus this person knitted a hummus thing hummus we're hummus because we're hummus and finally a hummus Furby and not the last one you'll see today what's our next folder called you ask it's called T-Rex and it's just rack stuff this is a baby picture of me taking the place of another child who was in a racks commercial deep cut well done Mr delicious as a T-Rex on the earth so big he's going to space he's almost at the Moon little T-Rex saying hummus it was well

here I am with a lemon in my mouth riding on Mr D as a T-Rex I don't know why I have so many tattoos racks you can eat here endless hummus bar this folder is just lemon stuff but there's only four things in it I think I got confused halfway through but here it is this is a lemon crab saying hummus and I think it's crank green so it's also me if only it we're also a dinosaur I didn't feel bad for the lemon before but I do a little bit now you don't have to understand that joke but there it is and finally this it's a crab with lemon lips and my glasses and it's got my press on nails turns out impossible to play guitar with the press on nails on your string fingers and we cap it all off with the last folder on my desktop this one is just labeled art it's just art it's things that were

big scary flying man I have a lot of little hairs I would love to get into carrot business just so we can make organic Darcy crunch carrots um good be weird do good if that's not the project for awesome I don't know what is for at some point I pretended to be a crab while doing Shakespeare I forgot about that until this moment this is just my very large face with the word beans superimposed over it because this is becoming my brand Eternal salad bar what a beautiful but creepy racks very Twin Peaks Justin going to the Moon in his spaceship car five foot nine brown eyes and a sundress which is just a Deering and John joke it's this that's nothing to do with the project for us I don't know if many people would buy hummus if this was The Branding but I know that I would we have to stop saying now we're cooking with gas we need to stop cooking with gas and it's not even as good as solar powered induction I could definitely see this on a t-shirt but then you'd have to explain it to people hummus somebody made a winter project for awesome cookies there's T-Rex there's crunching there's a bean pickle there's crank green look delicious really lovely we're here because we are here spiral I don't know how you do that that well little darsiered watercolor a little crabulous 2.0 no watercolor a little Lemon Lips watercolor tuberculosis focused Endeavor project for awesome

a feather boa and some big old lips beautiful project for awesome mandala again another quite creepy Rex image it's starting to feel kind of threatening with the Eternal salad bar this color pencil T-Rex is so huge he's got a head of hair which you just don't see on dinosaurs very often many of these things seem like they would have taken more than two days to do but I don't know I don't like I don't know how I've never made anything like this I have no idea how hard it is to make but it seems very difficult Lemon Lips no hips that's me Hank Green a bean peep a bunch of dogs pee for a you can cry here it's in the founding documents it's not required but it is encouraged I mean we did the coffee club we did the sock Club what's next this is gorgeous and must have taken a very long time had to be more than just a project for us a project for awesome vision board you just keep cramming stuff in because more weird things are gonna happen this is so cute he's wonderful that's art right I don't like what am I supposed to say T-Rex eating hummus and destroying pants will Darcy carrot very cute Tony orange I couldn't remember Ted lasso's name and I knew that his last name was a noun

just to notice a bunch of dinosaurs I did break an egg over my head I did immediately regret it maybe they were trying to predict that I would write butts on my head but I didn't Sharpie face at all this yes it's a beautiful self-care bunny well I love you card and there's a crank green inside of it down in the bottom of the heart so cute another doodle Board of things going on you are on earth and no one can take that away from you Hank Green's hunky chasa 100 a profit to charity we're queer because we're queer very nice t-shirt design that's lemon it's not having a good time I wasn't

what to say about this what's up with the giant space dinosaur I don't know it's going to the Moon obviously this is so great I love this it's so adorable dinosaurs in space Gumball Mike of course John Green getting Sharpie faced into from like a sort of Sigmund Freud character here all the way to a very punk rock figure and then there's Hank Green Lemon Lips no hips again this is very good but literally no hips in this situation and I love that p4a logo you made you are a Dino on the moon and no one can take that away from you and green in my new book The anthropubine refilled build can Edition my goodness and then the beans in my pickle by crank Green Oh I think all these were done by the same person so I don't know who it was but thank you it was genius crotch Tony orange again P for a plus I think that's basically the uh the digital download bundle AS p4a Plus and then of course there's this hanger fish crunching a lemon he's lovely and he's made a mistake certainly one of the greatest pieces of project for awesome art this year was these two long Furbies one is a lemon hummus long Furby and the other is a bean pickle long Furby with the crack in it that the beans are coming out of which did happen to my pickle it's not really anything more perfect than that I bought this as a sticker and I'm gonna put it on my laptop because I love my life we're hummus because we're a lemon crab with gigantic lips a lot of people make little compilation images of their whole weekend I love them this was a nice one a nice little Lemon Lips logo I had the Lemon Lips John Green watercolor sketch this little baby meeting it's Mommy strong sad with a crab playing with them you can't explain but it was a nice moment I really feel like it was the road to racks like it's a video game level one we have to fight that giant Dr Pepper peep then we gotta fight the bean pickle then we gotta fight the Lemon Lips and then we gotta fight just a bunch of coffee beans because at one point I did just eat raw coffee beans and then last you gotta fight Tyrannosaurus Rex cause it turns out maybe a lot of the beauty Aesthetics of that time came from thinking that people with consumption were extra hot it froze on John's face when he was making that frowny face he was it was like that for like a full 30 seconds and it was such a perfect meme face it's absolutely beautiful so you could just drink cap that for any any use that you want we're here because we're here but it spells out hummus raising nerdy to the power of awesome be weird do good and it's a T-Rex at the Rex new item Lemon Lips and it's just roaring out hummus and finally the first piece of art I saw and the last one I will show you today is this 3D art of beans stuffed inside of a Dr Pepper pea it was a truly magical project for awesome there were so many ridiculous beautiful memorable moments there was this I'll never forget that it was like I did a magic trick but I none of it was on purpose not even the confetti stuck to the balloon there are a lot of ways to find meaning and purpose in this world but the project for awesome is one that we kind of made up from scratch and it is just ever so good I'm so grateful to all of you who were a part of it in whatever way you were and of course I'm also very grateful to you John we had a really good time it was a good old time and now now I have to figure out how to take all my lights down without getting them all tangled and John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John doing something a little different today it's officially countdown time to project for us I set this video to Premiere so theoretically there are a bunch of people watching all at once right now and they're all in the chat together just chanting butt farting butt Fartman butt Fartman over and over again trying to summon him we'll see if that works if you don't know who butt Fartman is or beanie sandverbs or crank green or Dave the fish or Glenn of the Glenn and Dale of the Dale don't worry that's okay they're all mascots of former projects for awesome not this one what's gonna be the mascot of this project for awesome no one knows you don't know until you start and then immediately I turn into a crab for some reason and this happens which is great no one doesn't like this I didn't even realize we were making mascots for the project for awesome until last year after we had had like over a dozen of them and I don't remember the origin stories they all have origin stories if you're gonna read any of them you should read butt fartman's [Music] excellent well done everyone you can stop chanting now you successfully summoned him now in the chat or in comments if you're late you could just type in the best parts of the project for awesome according to you now you'd think that a 48-hour live stream dedicated to fixing the unfixable problems of humanity and Earth would not be so goofy this is actually something I've noticed quite a bit if you sort of know about the problems and you look at the problems and you say oh that's problem is problem that is somber it's not fun but in the moments when I see people actually working on hard problems ideally together in community with others the recognition of the magnitude of the problem is still there that didn't go away but also it just becomes human community and human Community is all of the things that humans always are whether that is silly or goofy or sad or serious or depressed or anxious or joyful or whatever it's not joyful in spite of the fact that it's directly interfacing with you know some of the greatest challenges that Humanity has to face it's joyful because it isn't like glancing at those things and then being ashamed that they exist it's just accepting that they are and that nothing can ever be perfect but we can work hard and when we work together we can magnify our impact which this year is already building off of over seven hundred thousand dollars in matching grants so if we can raise seven hundred thousand dollars during the project for awesome all of those initial dollars will be matched and we will be at 1.4 million dollars so recognizing the flaws in our world and then witnessing our combined impact yeah it's gonna be a little bit joyful and then you add in the sleep deprivation and you know you get what you get so during the first half of the project for awesome we will again be raising money for Partners in Health and save the children these are two organizations that work to make life better for some of the people who have the very least on our planet and they both do it in ways that build strong foundations for those communities the idea being that those people want to work hard for themselves and their families and their communities they want to help each other out there are things that weigh on those communities lack of Access to Health Care and education not having enough food or clean water we know from evidence from experience that if you give people the resources and a strong foundation on which to build they will build during the second half of the project for awesome the money will go to registered non-profits that are voted on by this community so we divide that up and we split it amongst 20 to 30 non-profits depending on how much we rate people all over have made videos talking about the great work that non-profits that they know about do those videos were submitted to project for awesome.com we'll watch some of them during the live stream but you can also just watch them on the website now and if you like the pitch you could vote on the Charities at project for awesome.com donate you will find a little rewards button you'll click on that and there'll be a lot of rewards you can scroll and scroll and find all the different things that are available and they're very good there's so much and we will talk about all of it at project for awesome.com live which is where you should go the moment this video ends which is right now John I'll see you there good morning John uh there's something about this isn't there Catherine turned to me after finishing your video from this week and she said I was engaged but I was relaxed I think the way we normally do these videos like isn't precisely that I mean I'm not gonna stop doing it this way I like this way this is the way this is the way but I don't think it's relaxing and like I'm getting older maybe the level of energy needs to come down a little bit sometimes a hamstring has to be the most ridiculously named muscle right there can't be a worse one than that Cath is weird like it's just uh somebody looked at that and was like that looks like a small cow but at least kath is like a living animal if it were called a veal string then I'd be like yeah that's equally ridiculous to hamstring that's that's the basic of the situation we're in with hamstring that's got to be the weirdest one I've been working on project for awesome perks because it's uh it's going up quick for the last four or five years we've been making various kinds of spray paint art where we've been using stencils on glass or canvas and when we were doing that we also made something by accident every year I used the same roll of paper as the drop cloth so he wouldn't get paint on whatever surface we were painting on and over the years that paper became really beautiful like it had all the stencil marks and then it had scuffs and Footprints and some of it started to rip and it was just like clear that we weren't going to use this paper again and and I literally like looked down at it in the dumpster and I was like I I can't throw that away I took it home and I cut out squares uh and then I graffiti mopped hangler fish on a bunch of them and they are the hanger fish art this year and they're all signed and numbered there's 250 of them and I'm excited to share them with people and of course it's the only time we're going to be able to do ones like this because that paper doesn't exist anymore it's a pretty good trade though I think and next year I'll have to figure out something else to do I'm not sure if that's not an optimistic or depressing um but I guess that's what figuring out something else to do is both of those things so I have a friend she's a pretty good friend and I go over to her place fairly frequently um and uh and she knows my name which is weird that I mentioned that go over to her place once to to meet a new member of her family she's got a new dog it's extremely cute brand new dog didn't exist a couple months ago and she's like this is Hank meet Hank uh what what am I supposed to do with this like either this is an odd honor that is being bestowed on me or you forgot I existed this isn't a dog that came from the pound with a name this is a new dog that you had an infinite number of names that you could have given I'm not personally a name dogs human names kind of person I my dog was named lemon my cats have been named Cameo and gummy bear we don't run into that problem very often when someone shows up and they're like oh my name's gummy bear too you can do it I just think like avoid the names of people who are going to be at your house a lot and soon sorry it's true if you're watching this um just know that I never said anything and then it just sort of pinged around in there for years until this I forgot about gluteus maximus gluteus maximus is definitely the most ridiculous name for a gluteus maximus like your butt is the emperor of Rome gluteus maximus runs [Music] and [Music] I like to say if it ain't folk don't Blix it it's just funnier John I'll see you tomorrow good morning John surprise it's me I'm here on the channel I thought I was getting a colonoscopy today but it turns out that I'm not you'd think that's something I would know I scheduled one and then I started a new medicine and then they wanted to push it back but then I didn't take it off my schedule so I have one in May it's fine you don't need to know but that means I had a whole extra day which is great because I have a lot to do put on a presentation about titles and thumbnails thinking about redesigning my office I got a couple of updates I need to send out to the community here project for awesome is coming I think I might have like a mild existential crisis about halfway through the day I need to get lunch at some point I might just make a sandwich first the subscriptions system that we use to run the awesome socks club and coffee and also Pizza Miss stuff they had a weird glitch so it may have sent you an email that you're gonna get skipped for this month you won't uh we're working on a fix uh sorry that shouldn't happen again as a man once said still some glitches to work out and I really am grateful because people are so understanding when stuff like this happens so thanks for that I'm so excited about how well those things have done we've got you know thousands of people getting coffee every month and tens of thousands of people getting socks every month it makes me think a lot about what's possible and thinking a lot about what's possible these days often requires me to think about what is impossible which is me doing more stuff which is a shame because I very much love to do more stuff I'm sure that's something no one's ever noticed about me also the project for awesome is approaching rapidly February 17th and video submissions are open we used to do it everybody would upload the video on the same day YouTube doesn't really care about that anymore so you can upload it beforehand get it into our system and then we can review the videos and pick out ones that we might want to feature during the project for awesome live stream so if you want to make your project for awesome video do that and then submit it at project for awesome.com if you don't know what I'm talking about the project for awesome is a yearly 48-hour live stream that John and I and friends have been doing since 2007. we raise money we send people things in exchange for that money both physical and digital things there's a whole campaign that will be live during the live stream during the first half we raise money for save the children and Partners in Health and during the second half we raise money for organizations voted on by the community and we decide that by watching videos that people make talking about the great work that organizations they care about do in their community and in the world so if you want to make a video supporting your favorite charity you can do that it doesn't have to be more than a minute long tell us about the problem that organization is interfacing with why it's a big deal and how they're trying to solve that problem that's that's the basic format of most YouTube videos about anything what is the problem why is it important what should we do about it that's so much of what humans do and it's a good format it's a reason why we do things that way I don't know which of the things that I do is the most important one or even which one I enjoy the most so that's like a weird thing for a bunch of chemical reactions to think I'm also going to be doing the nerdfighteria census fairly soon so if you haven't filled out the survey there's a link in the description to do that so that we can get more data about how people are feeling about nerdfighteria it's good to get a broad base of information from all across this community so that's in the description as well and what else is going on Catherine and I have been having a good old time with delete this lately we kind of fell into a new format called wet or dry where we talk about one wet thing and one dry thing and then try and figure out which of the things is better it sounds like a terrible idea for a podcast but it's maybe my best idea for a podcast ever it's very fun and it's been very silly it maybe is not for kids though just FYI I mostly mentioned that so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening and hydrogen isn't it interesting that there is an element where if you take away the electron it's just a proton it's still hydrogen that's how it works elements are defined by the number of protons they have and hydrogen has one proton so if there's just one proton it's hydrogen that's cool I don't know why it takes me out of the frame a little bit additional thing to share Hank's Channel got one of these so that see that's you right there you see yourself that's you that's what you look like to me it's not how I think of you anyway I have no idea which of the things that I just said is going to fit in this video definitely not all of it that's for sure John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John one thing I think people sense but I don't say that often is that I feel a pretty strong obligation to do good and interesting things with the tools that I have and probably the two most impactful uh things that I have easy access to are one this audience this group of people this community who have supported a lot of very good and interesting things over the years and then the second probably most powerful tool is the people who work at and the things that have been made by complexly all of the things I have been referring to as tools are human beings but yeah I hope you understand what I mean crash course in particular has become a pretty interesting thing in the world of educational media which has resulted in lots of people like knock it on our doors to see if they can invest or partner with us in various ways a lot and to figure out what to do with an asset like that all you really have to do is to sort of understand the entire problem landscape of all of global education so that should be fine but a few years back we did decide to start walking down a road like this and it did start with a lot of trying to figure out what the problems that students in the US in particular face how to imagine those barriers and how to lower them obviously I don't know much about that I'm a YouTuber with a background in Biochemistry so it involved talking to a lot of people who are actually in higher education because we wanted to have a kind of thing that sort of supported people on their Bridge from high school to college in the U.S so for a little bit of context right now at a state school it costs about twelve hundred dollars for a three credit course you can also get credits while you are in high school but sometimes those credits don't transfer indeed lots of these credits don't transfer easily from school to school and figure out when and how they do is a big messy mess and that is just one part of the big messy mess that is the entire education bureaucracy that is more complicated if you have fewer resources and also you probably have less access to information or fewer people who are around you who've been through the system before so as we were doing our research we identified that as actually one of the main barriers that some people just don't know a lot about how this system works and that can result in costly mistakes the other like main big barrier though which is the one that people most often cite when they drop out of school is cost it's just that it costs a lot of money at some point in the last five years some folks at YouTube introduced us to some folks at Arizona State University which is a large public research University with a specific goal of judging itself not by like its rejection rates and how exclusive they are but by how many people they can include in their school so after a lot of conversations and a lot of work from a lot of people we ended up with a thing that's called study hall study hall has like four main parts right now there's fast guides which is like a guide to what different college majors are about what they do for you what people end up doing usually once you get them how to college which is just a crash course on how College Works College foundations which are videos that cover foundational college courses that tons of people have to take and finally a thing that just launched this week at gostudyhall.com which is a way of going from those College foundations course to an actual course that you're taking online that you can get transferable college credit for from Arizona State University the videos are of course still free on YouTube but if you want to take the course you start out by paying 25 once you've signed up and the course Begins the first one begins on March 7th you could take the class with a cohort of students with faculty support and at the end of the course if you think that the course did a good job of teaching you and you like the grade that you got you can pay 400 for a transferable college credit so basically we're providing an option to get foundational course knowledge and transferable credits from a major research institution with more flexibility and at a lower cost and like I kind of can't believe that's real the goal is not to replace college with YouTube videos it's to look closely at the barriers and lower the ones that we can I wish we could fix the whole system with one sweeping action but as long as we can't do that we gotta do what we can with what we have so if you know folks that might be interested in this please tell them about it and of course thank you so much to the dozens of people who have been working on this in one way or another for years now who are at complexly or ASU or at YouTube I'm so proud of the work that we've done and I'm so excited to have it out there John I'll see you on Tuesday not making a video next week instead I'm gonna get a colonoscopy so just so you know that ah my goodness good morning John so I've noticed that for the last few videos you are basically doing just whatever I am doing I did low budget Bo Burnham you did a low budget Bo Burnham I did a Google autofill thing you did a Google autofill thing I think this is cheating or at least lazy and so I am going to make it hard for you by taking you behind the scenes to one of the most advanced aquarium exhibits in the whole world I actually got to tour this exhibit before it actually existed to see the complexity of what makes it all come together because you'd think okay an aquarium on the coast that can't be that complicated pump seawater in put fish in the sea water and it's beautiful well it is more complicated than that than three years ago I actually made a whole video about it and you can watch it but not all ocean is the same in particular it's very different at different depths and there are animals in the deep sea that basically no one gets to see it's extremely hard to go down there it's also hard to get the animals to the surface and once they're at the surface the sea water is so different from the water of the deep sea that they cannot survive in it but at the mount Monterey Bay Aquarium they wanted people to be able to walk amongst the animals of the deep sea just to exist in the same space system and if you go to that exhibit which I have not been able to do yet you can do just that you are in the dark walking through Halls surrounded by animals that typically inhabit the most difficult to visit place on Earth and it is designed to appear to the people walking through the exhibit that that's all fairly effortless it's just something for you to enjoy not for you to understand the engineering behind how it is possible but before the exhibit opened I got to see how that seemingly effortless cohabitation between humans and deep sea animals is actually extremely complicated and fairly precarious so look when I walked into this I thought the hardest part of this process was going to be pressurizing the water to the same pressures as the deep sea because water is very heavy and down at the bottom of the ocean there is a lot of water on top of you enough pressure to very easily kill you but I you know I need to exist at a certain pressure of atmospheric pressure in order to exist and the difference between the ocean pressure at the bottom of the sea and the ocean pressure at the top of the sea is bigger than the difference between air pressure at sea level and space but many deep sea creatures don't have very much gas inside of them so if you bring them up slowly enough they'll be fine so if you don't actually have to pressurize the water what's the concern the trouble is that the sea water itself is different it has higher salinity very consistent low temperature and really consistent gas concentrations that are very different from surface level water and so behind every wall at into the deep there are systems that take water from Monterey Bay and turn it into a simulation of deep sea water and it turns out the hardest part of this is removing the perfect amount of oxygen oxygen is great but it is also a super reactive molecule and these animals are used to an environment with a super low oxygen concentration the oxygen of surface sea level would absolutely kill many of them and so all of the water in this aquarium must be run through a equipment that was designed I'm not kidding for Semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing among other things situations where they really need to control the amount of different chemicals present in a system by running the water over tons of tiny thin membrane straws with very low pressure inside the oxygen basically gets sucked out of the water flowing into the area of lower oxygen but of course they can't take out too much or the animals will asphyxiate it has to be perfectly balanced every hour of every day I cannot go to the deep sea and I probably shouldn't I should leave that to the researchers who are dedicated to understanding and protecting it but the people at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and places like them have worked extremely hard to bring those environments those other worlds within our own to as many of us as they can to inspire wonder and joy and awe at the marvels of our planet and the Curiosity and Ingenuity of the people who inhabit it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John thanks for joining me in our brand new format which I'm sure we will bring back again but today instead of that I'm back in the old space and I'm going to do an old format this one is the one where you ask Google what questions people have been asking by starting to ask it a question and not finish good old Google autocomplete why is there an egg shortage well broadly it is because we build many systems for efficiency rather than resilience if you want to make a lot of eggs really cheap you got to have one very big room with a whole lot of chickens in it but that's also a fantastic circumstance for the transmission of disease like bird flu in order to control diseases Farmers have to kill all of the birds in a facility when one bird gets bird flu and then disinfect the whole place over 60 million birds have been killed in the current bird flu outbreak and that decreases the number of eggs on the market while demand stays roughly the same five dollars for a dozen eggs is a lot of money compared to what we were spending this time last year but a dollar 33 for a dozen eggs which is what we were spending this time last year is a price that some would argue should be a little bit bit higher to allow for more resiliency in that system why is the sky blue the white light that comes from the sun is made of a bunch of different wavelengths that all look different colors to us the gases in our atmosphere are good at scattering blue wavelengths out of the white light so the sun with the blue ticking out looks a little bit yellow while the sky with a blue scattering around looks like blue but as I have said before the sky doesn't exist It's Just an Illusion a kind of one colored rainbow why is my poop green could be a lot of different things uh probably something you ate either it's a bunch of green vegetable stuff or green food coloring or maybe some antibiotics or different medications will turn your poop green if it's accompanied by diarrhea or other symptoms that have been going on for multiple days go see a doctor I'm not a doctor and neither is the internet why is my eye twitching I don't know same though maybe it's because of the this we don't actually know why I was twitched though it's definitely correlated with fatigue and stress and if you don't have one or the other or both of those well done I'm just I'm loving that for you I'm not I'm fine why is the flag at half mass in the U.S and probably other places definitely Canada now that I found this clip when mourning something we often put the flag only halfway up this is sometimes because of like big National tragedies that are in the news but it's also often because of the death of a member of the government or some public servant and it varies from state to state flag Express which sells flags keeps track of this on their website so you can always know if you want to why is my poop black this is significantly more concerning and less common than green poop you should probably go see a doctor immediately it could be because you're bleeding somewhere in your GI tract why is it called Black Friday well At the moment I'm thinking it has something to do with poop but I know that that can't be right so I'll look it up I guess I looked it up and I'm gonna be honest with you it's boring it's like oh there's a lot of traffic on the day after Thanksgiving on the roads people didn't like that why is JJ Watt retiring I don't know man that sounds like a pretty personal question why is these diesel so expensive well it's taxed a little bit higher so that makes it a little bit more expensive also recently we started to require in the US low sulfur diesel because of the human health consequences of having all that sulfur in the air the biggest reason is that when you have a barrel of crude oil the part that can get turned into gasoline is fairly big and it's more flexible that part can be used for a bunch of different stuff that's like high value and low value and you can sort of mix up the market based on what's most needed and most expensive well the part that can get turned into diesel is smaller and the stuff it can get turned into is more valuable than diesel like jet fuel so there's just more higher value demand for the diesel fraction of the crude which drives up the price and our final question in the Google autocomplete list why is my dog shaking and gosh I don't know that that sounds scary I'm sorry about your dog it could be stress anxiety nervousness cold excitement but if this is a new thing and you're worried about it again I'm not a doctor of animals or people so maybe you should go see the vet John after 16 years I still love making videos with you why is this so much fun I don't know but I like it and I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John this is a weird way to make a video I recently fell down while ice skating I didn't fall down actually I dove in front of Oren to make him laugh because I will do anything to see that little kid smile ankle on my hip stayed like in the same place just sort of like right in line with each other but unfortunately my need not occupy any space inside of that line um so that hurts and now I'm squatting this is probably an observation people have made about Los Angeles before but but it's very weird that they're a lot a lot of advertisement tens of millions of dollars of advertisements that are asking me to consider a film or television show for awards Sarah 9921 members of The Academy so each one of those ads is for an audience of less than ten thousand the thing is it must work like they wouldn't do it if it didn't work but how many people that kind of sway so it was really it's not even about the 9921 it's about the like 45 people who might change their votes based on seeing this thing if you could just find those 45 people and give them each a million dollars it would be the same thing all because there's that much economic value I'm now I'm doing stand-up comedy except I'm not I'm just doing stand-up like upset it's a lot of stand-up comedy these days was really just stand up upset I'm gonna do squat down upsettity that's give me loving like I could make a really bad joke uh and everybody'd be like ah but on artificial intelligence makes a really bad joke and everybody loses their minds but this makes sense because if I ask you what like 522 times 8 divided by 64 is no like you don't know if the computer does that not a big deal but if you do that in front of me everybody would lose their minds like I would be like oh like when computers could first do those math problems was it like that were people that freaked out like the way that we were like write a poem about Gilligan's Island in the style of 50 Cent and it didn't like the I would do it like oh wow people felt when calculators were first already I can see this happening where we're like well yeah I mean of course AI can tell you how to hot wire a car as a Shakespearean sonnet but only if you give it like an ethical dilemma as a reason to tell you why to hotwire a car that's no big deal that's what AI does it's been a month we adapt so fast like we're gonna make a living computer sometime in my life it seems like and that's gonna be like amazing huge news on Friday they'll be like we found alien life in a computer we accidentally did that and then on Wednesday it won't even be like new gossip it'll be the same gossip but 40 years from now would be just like Harry Styles and Taylor Swift doing something and I love it and then a year later it'd be like yes this is my friend Steve he's a computer man he's a man-made of computer and he's my friend and that's not weird we this is what we do I found a sticker let me read you what it says it says Samantha Rose Garrison vampire boy available on all streaming platforms [Music] killing our favorite toys little did you know I haven't been before little did you know I could give you a toy of all the best places [Music] good morning John I know that we said maybe we weren't going to do videos this week but hey I found something that I really wanted to share with you and it is this lid to a tea it's a tea lid from a Boba place and it's specifically a tea lid that you can use for Boba so I guess you can do hot Boba and you would put the Boba straw through this part of the teal and then you got your normal sipping hole here this is the hy90m5 if you want to look it up and there's something very odd about this tea lid and I want to know what's going on and I can't figure out the answer and so I'm turning to the power that I have and should not abuse in this way but please someone to help me figure out what's going on if you take a look at the hy90 M5 can we get a focus you will see that it says heat 110 degrees Celsius that to me is very weird on its own but then also notice that the one and the one are different fonts I'm gonna talk through why I think this is so strange for the hy90m5 to say heat one one zero degrees Celsius and have the ones be in two different fonts first of all tea is made out of liquid water and liquid water cannot get hotter than 100 degrees Celsius so you cannot heat tea hotter than 100 degrees Celsius unless you're changing the pressure unless you are putting it in a pressure vessel and putting a bunch of extra air molecules in there you cannot heat to above 100 degrees Celsius you especially cannot do that in Montana where we're way above sea level but that's not part of the conversation the only thing that makes sense that it means to me is that this beverage is hot like you wanted to re-emphasize the part where it says caution hot across the top you wanted to reemphasize that with the heat of the drink in here is 110 degrees Celsius which to an American does not sound very hot so that's a problem but I understand this lid is not necessarily made for an American audience because it's a bobolin and we haven't been on the Boba train for that long and we certainly haven't been on the hot Boba train for very long I have of course looked this up it's a lid from Taiwan where they use celsius so the only thing that makes sense is that they put heat 110 degrees Celsius just to re-emphasize that this is very hot it's hotter than you think it is it's hotter than boiling water even though that is literally impossible unless it contains pure steam so I want to tell you the incorrect thing that I thought about this I thought that it said heat 110 degrees Celsius because originally it said heat 100 degrees Celsius and then somebody decided to take off one of the zeros and add a one just to totally emphasize that this is hotter than boiling water even though that's not possible then it can't it isn't it isn't but they wanted people to be safe so they added an extra 10 degrees Celsius to an already impossible temperature and when they did that they used a different phone they didn't have access to the original document they had to cut and paste to make it look like it said 110 degrees Celsius in fact if you look very close the bottom of this one is a little bit higher than the bottom of this one so it's definitely Photoshop and the only reason to do that is if you want to make get more clear that this is very hot liquid but I wanted to confirm this so I went on the internet and I looked up the hy90 M5 and John it used to say 120 degrees Celsius it used to say 120 degrees Celsius and they changed it to a lower temperature I assume because some patent like me was like there isn't a way that the t is 120 degrees Celsius it would just be steam it would be gaseous water it would explode and so they lowered it to an also impossible temperature like somebody did that making sure that extra work was done so that no one would be happy if anybody has any theories about how this happened that more accurately explains the given circumstances in ways that are less infuriating please let me know John I hope you're having a wonderful New Year's and I'll see you in 2023 good morning John it is likely my last video of 2015. 2020 to 2022. Juicy crust pins get down it's gonna be 2023 John I'm very grateful to you for sharing some thoughts about my books I remember when the second one was coming out I was like talking to Media about it and stuff and people were like what's this about and I'm terrible at that so I said like the first book I kind of wrote to try and like share more clearly what the internet is actually like and this book though the second one is more like what I think it's gonna be like and it is legitimately weird to watch as various parallels hit I just think that fiction writing and reading is a really good place to find Insight because when I think about like Elon and Twitter it's very hard not to get caught up in a lot of the details and a lot of like my biggest concerns about Society what I'm thinking about Peter and Altus it's like oh yeah yeah I get that I know all about that it's very easy to manufacture whatever reasoning you need to do the thing and get the thing that you are hungry for and there's not that many things that people get hungry for it's like food is one of them water air Joy sex meaning love it's a pretty short list so it makes perfect sense for there to be a character who will do literally the opposite of what he has spent his whole public life championing in order to get status because it brings him meaning and he desperately wants that we are very bad like research shows this we are very bad at arguing with ourselves we almost always end up believing what we want to believe and that's a super fun thing to say about other people but it's less comfortable to say about ourselves but it is true of all of us and it's a good thing to look at as we head into a new year with things changing very fast one thing I've learned about me is that I'm very good at becoming whatever an internet platform wants me to be I just had a two go viral on Mastodon I had the top two to the day on Mastodon I got good at YouTube and then Twitter and then Tick Tock and I like spending time in those places they bring me joy they bring me connection they bring me meaning they bring me attention so it's so hard to trust my instincts about whether it's good to spend time I'm in those places and what to do while I'm there because I'm arguing with myself and myself wants to do it so I don't know like should I do what we did for like the first 10 years of this and just like Vibe with what I think is interesting and fly toward the light like a mom or should I be constantly second guessing myself and wondering whether my like pro-social biology is being hacked by algorithms for anti-social aims that are resulting in epidemics of misinformation and disconnection and loneliness I guess John I need to do both which is annoying because it's work it's not just like job work either it's like personal work it's work I have to do on myself to understand my motivations gotta understand my responsibilities that's a no I don't want to I don't want to do that it sucks a little bit to feel conflicted about the things that bring you Joy and how do we make progress unless we talk about problems right like there isn't a way but I do honestly think that there is Damage Done by never being able to see anything without also simultaneously critique like there is critique there there's space for it but you can also love it all of the people I love there is they have space for critique including myself everything has room for improvement but nobody thinks that like room for improvement is synonymous with evil all right what I think I'm trying to get at is that I need to use the internet and internet Platforms in ways where I think I'm more engaging with problems than creating problems more focused on doing work than on deepening conflict but I need to err on the side of being really quite sure if it feels like it might be a little bit good might be a little bit bad I'm arguing with myself and myself as the person who's about to get a lot of attention and notoriety and Status by Tweeting or saying the thing that I'm not sure if it's good or bad are you are you not sure or do you just not want to look too hard at it yeah I thought so John I will see you in 2023 good morning John in 2010 YouTube celebrated itself with a thing called YouTube Rewind at that point this was just a top 10 list of the most popular YouTube videos of the Year something that you could do back in 2010 when a viral video was something that happened maybe once a week and not a hundred times per day like it does now but YouTube Rewind really became itself in 2012 with a video that brought lots of top YouTubers into physical Studios together to be a part of the memes I remember feeling quite left out that I was not a YouTube Rewind that year or the next year so we did manage to slip into what may have been the peak of the series rewind 2014 which is a Vibe even re-watching that though it's clear that there is a problem already a YouTube video was moving away from being a genre of content and toward being a kind of content to illustrate what I mean by that and the shift that really happened between 2016 and 2018 allow me to propose to you a thought experiment Spotify rewind a single video that attempts to encapsulate the entire music Industries year in six minutes no one wants this because it does not make any sense now starting in 2016 Spotify started to do something that people actually liked then and continue to like now rapt is a recap of what you liked not like what happened in music that year what you enjoyed in music and podcasts now on YouTube in 2016 things were simple enough that people were like yeah okay a fair number of these folks are people I have some affinity for or at least familiar with but by 2018 the story of YouTube was very big very complex and had been really quite full of Scandal and more than anything a YouTube video was not a genre of content anymore it was a kind of content it was not a single Community anymore it was many communities and many of those communities disliked each other they had to have known that people would not like it but in the way of large companies I'm sure a lot of people looked at it and they said this is bad but it's the thing that we do and we've done it so let's do it now in response to it being the most disliked YouTube video ever in 2019 they just did like another top 10 video except with more production value and people also disliked that it was clear to me at that point that there would never be a YouTube Rewind and there was not another YouTube Rewind I would like to propose that we bring it back now people are annoyed by Spotify wrapped they will say Spotify rap sucks either because they don't use Spotify and annoys them to feel left out or because they think that like your taste in music doesn't make you an interesting person but I am neither of those kinds of person and I actually think that Spotify raps delivers a ton of value to the people who make content the people who use the platform and the platform itself it seems to be a huge win it shows me who I love which I actually don't know I don't know what YouTuber I watch the most of it gives people content to share if they would like to that's great promotion for Spotify and for the musicians and podcasters who are featured and I think that it gives especially smaller podcasters and musicians a chance to feel appreciated and to connect with their audience I think that this is what YouTube Rewind should be and I think that they should just call it YouTube Rewind I think that that's great a breakdown of my year on YouTube who did I watch who did I like is there a Creator who basically like I'm a bigger fan of them than anyone else because I bet I am I bet I'm gonna like 0.1 percent of a few creators any comments have you left how many videos have you liked how many super thanks and super chats have you sent and in a perfect world there's a chance for me to type a message to my favorite Creator and then the day after YouTube Rewind happens creators get their own rewind that gives them all their stats and a few messages from people who appreciate their content I think Spotify wrapped does good things for the audience the creators and the platforms and I think for the people who find it annoying they're part of the discourse too it's a fun day and it fixes all of YouTube rewinds original problems that it had to pick winners that it had to try and portray YouTube in a particular way that was maybe not consistent with how we were imagining it and of course with YouTube no longer being anything like a unified culture and so YouTube if you're listening put me in coach my Consulting rates are high they consist entirely of donations to Partners in Health John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John I want to tell you about one of the coolest things I've ever found out in my life it really threw me for a loop and I want to throw you for the same Loop so join me on the journey when studying life on our planet it is sometimes useful to think about like how much the living matter of the planet weighs on its own I'm this is enough of this code on its own the idea of living matter is pretty freaking weird right living matter but that's what we are and that matter has mass like I have about 90 000 grams of living matter or do I like not really most of it's water like life couldn't exist without it but it isn't really part of the living system it's kind of just like an ocean that I'm carrying around in a sack with me everywhere I go so that I can do the chemistry that is life what the scientific establishment has decided to do is just count the carbon which makes sense I think that's a good way to do it of course it's not perfectly precise but it's precise enough we call this biomass for example if you look at the biomass of all mammals around a third of it human beings if that seems weird to you it's going to be way weirder than that that's like the least weird thing in the video another third is cows just cows now you might be thinking that leaves the final third for wild mammals I'm sorry no uh further 30 is the rest of the Agricultural animals and four percent four percent of mammal biomass is wild mammals all of the whales and elephants and skunks and armadillos and shrews now is that the weirdest thing in the video no it's not I used to think when I heard this stat that this meant that there used to be a hundred percent wild mammals and now like 96 of them have been replaced by agricultural animals and humans that's not what happened around a hundred thousand years ago humans had a very tentative foothold on the planet pretty insignificant species in terms of biomass and at that point wild mammal biomass was at its peak but had been roughly the same for a very long time it wasn't increasing it wasn't decreasing it was quite stable between 100 000 years ago and ten thousand years ago human biomass changed some but was still pretty insignificant to ten thousand years but wild mammal biomass dropped by like 25 a very big very fast drop we call this the quaternary megafauna Extinction it was an Extinction event of almost entirely very large mammals lots of debate about this definitely a contributor to it uh was human it's very tightly coincided with the arrival of humans in North and South America and then separately in Australia what happens next is the very weird part between 10 000 years ago and 100 years ago agriculture happens like in a big way while the mammal biomass Falls by a further third but the total mammal biomass increases beyond what it ever was purely because of humans and livestock and now in the year 2022 humans by themselves represent three times more biomass than all mammals combined before humans we are heavy in the last hundred thousand years there has been an 85 percent decrease in the wild mammal biomass and an 800 percent increase in the total mammal biomass throughout this video I've been trying to not have any particular judgment about whether the world should be the way that it is just that it's fascinating that it is the way that it is but entering into our conclusion here uh it's bad like it's bad to have an 85 decrease in Wild mammal biomass but it's also very complex like the Earth is absolutely hundred percent at its historical maximum of complicated brains I don't know if y'all caught this but a few days ago some baby was born that was the eight billionth person on the planet I hope they at least got a certificate so I don't really know what to say about this except that obviously we need to be doing all of this quite thoughtfully because this is a very big and fast change and I think that you can make the case that we are actually doing it more thoughtfully now than we were a hundred years ago it's also really great to be able to get coffee and socks delivered to your door once a month and to know that there are people working hard to try and do that as thoughtfully as possible coffee plantations can for example lead to a lot of deforestation but it can also be done in partnership with a forest the small farmers who work with the awesome coffee Club work hard to decrease deforestation and to practice regenerative agriculture the stock club's closing Monday there will not be another VLAN Brothers video between now and then so if you want to sign up you got to do it now the coffee Club will remain open perpetually John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John it's Thursday what am I doing here this is now one of my days I'm making two videos this week because I want to explain something you may have noticed you probably didn't but you might have they were planning on having the awesome socks Club window open for two weeks and now we are into our third week what is that about well we thought that when we launched you would have the ability to switch over from crew socks which are like up to the calf and to ankle socks which starting in January so you could switch over and in January get your first pair of ankle socks and because technology is hard that wasn't the case it's so hard just that one feature has been quite a difficulty it makes me feel like I would never pay a lot of money to acquire a technology company but if we closed it down it would become very hard to switch people over to the ankle socks so we kept it open and now that feature is live and you can go to awesomesocs.club and there's a link and there's also a link down in the description that you can go to if you'd like to switch to ankle socks starting in January you can't do it before then because we won't have ankle socks until January but now that that feature is live it does mean that the stock subscription window will close on Monday the 21st so this is really easier last week for real this time just because there's been a bunch of people who wanted to switch over and haven't been able to I wanted to make a video just like get that message out as far as it could possibly get also really excited about the light roast for the coffee club that launched this week we don't have decaf yet I'm a decaf Drinker we're gonna get there turns out decaf is surprisingly complicated and we want to do it right that's like the whole thing here the idea is that like we're working hard to make sure that the the things we make are like really high quality you get to wear some art on your feet or you get to have like the best coffee that just tastes really good and is good for the world and if we can't do decaf right we're not going to do decaf until we can and when we do I will tell you all all about how decaf is made which is fascinating and why it's so complicated to do it well anyway just want to tell you about the sock thing John you'll see me tomorrow good morning John a few months ago I made a video arguing that Elon Musk misunderstood the challenges of content moderation in social media and that I figured he was quickly discovering as nilai Patel has said that the main product of a social media platform is content moderation whether that's recommendations or algorithmic feeds or demoting and censoring hateful content I think that I was right about that but also that Elon was right about something else that I totally missed and should have seen I am a person who professionally understands a large group of people that's not the whole job but it's a big piece of it like understanding what people will like what they are thinking about what they're concerned about what they're worried about what they're excited about Elon Musk is absolutely right that his people his audience are really worried about something that they call Free Speech this is not what I call free speech and it is not what is protected by the First Amendment but it is a thing and it's a totally legitimate thing here it is internet media platforms have a huge influence on society and there are people who work at those platforms who we do not know know and thus cannot trust who have a huge influence on what is allowed on those platforms and what is promoted and demoted that's real and it's weird and it's worrying because this is a lot of how people communicate now now what Elon Musk said out loud about this was if people want laws preventing speech they'll pass laws preventing speech and until that happens Twitter should just allow all legal speech that's what he said but what he meant was somebody's going to be making these subjective moderation decisions and I don't trust them but I do trust myself and a lot of other people trust me too as I tweeted a few weeks ago a lot of people who say they want free speech actually just want to be the one in charge of which speech is free I thought elon's audience was going to get super mad at him very quickly because it would turn out that he would have to continue making all these subjective content moderation decisions because Twitter still had to be a business that was appealing to users and advertisers I was totally wrong about this Elon Musk doesn't need to change the content moderation policies of Twitter in order to satisfy his audience because this isn't about policy it's about Vibes it's not about the decisions it's about who is making the decisions indeed so far he hasn't changed any policies though I'm not going to put it past it even the ones that he was most upset about before he was in charge and it seems mostly like his audience isn't at all concerned about that so elon's obviously feeling very empowered so is his audience but now we have the opposite problem his people are happy everybody else is either unhappy or at least concerned because remember I just said this it was never about the decisions it was about The Vibes it was about who's making the decisions and a lot of people are not and will never be fans of Elon Musk Twitter's previous management for all of its failures did try to like listen to people who were upset and then make a decision that was thoughtful and transparent but Elon is mostly just gleefully antagonistic towards people who don't agree with that and if those people who've Twitter it just becomes an eight dollar a month subscription to the Elon Musk fan club and that's not a good website however right now the opposite is happening people are flocking to Twitter specifically because of Elon musk's erratic Behavior is the second thing he was right about that I didn't get people don't want Twitter to be stable they want it to be reality TV drama constantly unfolding before them feeling important despite being mostly inconsequential leaning into the interesting has been good for Twitter's growth but I think it's been very bad for Twitter internally and I think it's been bad for advertising dollars and I have no idea whether you can build a sustainable business this way it seems like it would be hard uh and there are a number of challenges that Twitter will need to overcome but what I do know is that while Twitter only occasionally brings me joy the awesome socks Club brings me joy every single month you can get a different pair of socks designed by a different independent artist to deliver to your door once a month free shipping cancel anytime ankle socks or mid-calf Crews now we're shipping out of the EU so you don't have to worry about Customs if you're in Europe I just want to make this as easy a decision as possible the socks are super comfy people will tell you this they're all I wear anymore and 100 of the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John I recently realized that I have an obsession I didn't know about which is not that unusual for me I was just scrolling through my photos like you do and I noticed that in the last few weeks I've taken a lot of pictures of signs so then I just searched Google photos for signs and I found out that I have taken like hundreds of pictures of signs over the last 15 years the earliest one was actually from 2004 so we're we're getting up close to 20. and a lot of them are just objectively very good so I'm going to share with you now my favorites one thing I love about a sign is if it's telling me more than it thinks it's telling me for example this Swan Hunters must have visible means of retrieval sign told me that there are Swan hunters in the world and that sometimes they shoot a swan that they cannot retrieve and that that is a problem that can only really be avoided in one way this sign told me that pit toilets are cleaned by human beings which is something I probably should have known but didn't it also just has a tremendous Kick-Ass aesthetic with all of the scratch graffiti this sign told me that somebody kicked the pony I also really like secret signs like this one I found on the inside door of a mailbox I also like signs that tell me there's a story without telling me what the story is like these three signs that all say do not enter but one of them has been taped over like why why tape over one there is a story here I cannot imagine what it is I love a beautiful sign but I also love a sign that becomes more beautiful like this Railway marker the way that the coding on the sign fractal differently given the different shape of the W and the five same with these two danger signs so great and this rusted up Beast was at that same power station which was behind the lab I worked at in 2004. these were the oldest photos I have of signs possibly this was the beginning of my obsession oh so long ago aging signs is something I really seem to be into I looked at this one for a really long time but I could never figure out what the danger was and then there's the sign marker at the end of a trail in the National Bison Range that I have taken pictures of so many times that I have a catalog of its deterioration I love signs that try to be very clear and succeed like this danger sign I saw in Italy but I also love signs that try too hard to be very clear like this no e-bike sign that has one two three four different indicate caters that it's talking specifically about e-bikes very clearly every person in the meeting had a different idea for how to represent e-bikes and they decided to use all of them but most of all my favorite genre of sign it's clear and looking through them is signs that are accidentally funny but before we get to that I gotta remind you that you are going to need to buy socks throughout your life but instead of that being a chore I want to take care of it for you the awesome socks Club will send you a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist every month we've worked hard to make them cozy and durable and delightful shipping is free you can cancel anytime and all the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone you can sign up for ankle socks or mid-calf cruise and you can get five dollars off your first month with a link in the description you can pause the video right now I will still be here when you get back so what do I mean by unintentionally funny designs well there is a Hall of Fame example here in Missoula Montana this sign which is meant to be two signs but it is impossible to not read it as one certain misspelled signs can be very funny for example this yard sale sign was a huge win for me once I really hit the jackpot when they were reorganizing my grocery store got snack time Eye Care and feminine care breakfast juices and Candy as well as baby care bleach dish soap this one I can't really tell if it was meant to be funny it seemed entirely sincere so I'm including it then there's this giant bronze banana in Palm Springs one of the hottest places in America and it's hot it's a hot banana it's a hot banana it's on the edge of whether this is a sign but these labeled poster boxes from the dftba warehouse which can either be red top to bottom or bottom to top giving very different perspectives on the human story and then I'm gonna end with one of my faves is it my favorite I don't know maybe maybe it is but please don't flash the octopus it's it's in it's at least in the top tier John you can only sign up for the awesome Sox Club this week and next week so you might as well go do it now I'll see you on Tuesday oh look and as a special present this is wild I had 15 extra seconds in this video even though the script was very long so I I don't know what I did I guess I talked really fast but here's some others of my favorites okay five dollars off the awesome socks club with the link in the description good morning John so a couple of months ago I posted a video of me making headquarter fish art for project for awesome donors and there were a bunch of people helping me right here this person is Monica tranelle the reason she's there is that she's running for congress and I wanted to maybe talk to her if I could and so I emailed her and she said let's have coffee and I said let's let's make fish so that was the first time I met Monica trannell but over the last few months I've met her a few more times mostly because I said I would like to rent out some rooms and interview you in them publicly time for some honesty I don't know how to be a person with a big audience who also doesn't like the way that the world is obviously different people have different views on the way that the world should be but I have mine I don't like a lot of the way things are we've had an audience of some kind for a long time I remember celebrating the election of Barack Obama with you like the first one while we were on tour I think we've been doing this for a while but most of what we've done over the years has been pretty nationally focused which makes a lot of sense because our audience is isn't even National it's International so focusing local like very few people here are going to have the opportunity to vote for Monica trannell some of you though and you better because she's great but in general I've started to feel like the Relentless focus on the biggest possible scope of all conversations that always being National isn't good I live in Montana a state that Trump won by 16 in 2020 and by 20 in 2016 but in 2016 we also elected a Democratic governor and we have a Democratic senator John tester who is amazing I don't think anybody would expect that I think most people don't know that because it doesn't fit into the national narrative we are a very red state that does a lot of pretty blue things we can only really tell ourselves simple stories when we don't let a lot of data in now I understand not letting a lot of data and it's very complicated and we want to tell simple stories so that people will believe the thing but these simple stories are starting to Rend Rend so when Joe Biden's team emailed me and they were like do you want to come to the White House to hang out with the president I was like yeah I do but I really only have so much time this year and I'm focusing a lot on what's going on in my community I want to think about that I want to be aware of that I want to know how amazing Monica trannell is and she is amazing and if she doesn't win it's going to be because of a focus on National politics like her opponent isn't very popular but Democrats are unpopular she's put like fifty thousand miles on her minivan traveling across what is one of the largest districts in America talking to people in 16 counties and two tribal Nations and she keeps telling me every chance she gets that she just wishes that I and everybody else could see the America that she sees when she goes out there to listen to people what those conversations are telling her is that people are a lot more complex than they get credit for and that seems wrong to me but her perspective is actually backed up by the research which shows that people see themselves as being pretty 60 40 on stuff but they see their opponents as being very 100 zero on everything in fact there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fit into broader narratives and because it doesn't we just don't ever think about it or talk about it that true fact feels unintuitive to me but it feels intuitive to Monica because she's the one out there doing the work that is why we hire other people to be our leaders because they get to know more about this than we ever will so that we can focus on doing the other thing the problems are very big but this country is messy and it is Led in a lot of different ways and the ballot that I get is a local ballot with local things on it so this election with the time that I had I decided to go local and I feel really good about it John I'll see you on Tuesday and if you can vote in this election you're going to go local too if you aren't sure how to vote where you are or whether you're registered Etc you can check out youtube.com how to vote in every state and I will tell you everything you need to know good morning John one thing we do not talk a lot about here on vlogbrothers is math but I'm about to show you a very low stakes math problem that you don't have to get right that did change the way that I see the social internet when the last vestiges of my timetable still holding on I initially realized that each of the numbers on the right was a multiple of the ones on the left from there I realized that there was a pattern 9 times 10 is 90 8 times 9 is 72 7 times 8 is 56 6 times 7 is 42. great so what is three this math question went viral on Twitter because people were arguing about what three is you may have even been Snappy enough to form an opinion yourself a lot of people said it was 12. a lot of people said it was 18. the 12 people and the 18 people were arguing with each other and they were all very certain that they were right team 18 pointed out that there was a sequence of numbers being multiplied ten nine eight seven and then the next number six would be six times three which would be eighteen twelve said that every number is being multiplied by itself plus one nine times ten six times seven and so three times four is twelve watching people on Twitter argue about this was a little like having sand thrown into my eyes because of course there are two correct answers to this question and neither of them is 12 or 18. the two correct answers are either 12 or 18 not 12 or 18 but 12 or 18. or the second correct answer is the question is wrong but here's the thing to me the right answer is 12. because n times n plus 1 just seems more mathy to me than a sequence being multiplied by the numbers but that's not right in this situation everyone who believes their answer is right is wrong the only people who are right are the ones who know they don't know now with math problems when they are unclear you know that it's a poorly created math problem but with almost every other kind of problem you know that if it is unclear that's actually a pretty good sign that it's a real problem like if it's clear how to solve it it's probably not that big of a problem but I learned something else very interesting from this confounding incorrect math problem which I started to learn when I noticed that people were talking about this rather than every other math problem there's nothing interesting about a math problem everyone agrees on one of the very few reasons that math goes viral is when people fight like this mess of an equation that I see all the time it might seem to a person like me that this would be an important math problem because it comes up a lot but mathematicians don't think this problem is interesting they wouldn't try to answer that question they would ask for it to be Rewritten and so if vague questions that are easy to argue about mislead us into Imagining the world incorrectly I it's important to ask why these questions are easy to argue about and here's why it's not just that people believe different things in this situation it's that it is easy to believe different things looking at this problem it is as easy to know that the answer is 12 as it is to know that the answer is 18. a question like that is bound to get some attention whether it is about math or guns or immigration particularly it will get a lot of questions from people who don't know that much about it because experts are aware that the problem is poorly phrased and badly done and so aren't really interfacing with it but for the rest of us these are situations where it's very easy to have one of several different opinions that are not the same answer questions like that due to the nature of humanity and its algorithms are gonna be the ones we're most likely to see and that's going to drive wedges and not just in the way that we usually think where it's like between two big political parties but also within political parties within communities within people who broadly agree with each other on almost everything they just don't notice because those aren't the interesting things when if the question was asked in a more complete way we wouldn't find it interesting because we'd all agree vague questions that lead to the formation of simple opinions that are likely to conflict with the opinions of others are much more likely to create conflict and thus much more likely to go viral and also very often the answers to those questions are invalid because the questions themselves are wrong John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John the other day I was on Twitter and I noticed a hashtag in the trending tab that I thought was appealing it was appealing to me it said nerd farters and I was like that's very funny I wonder I wonder what that is and honestly I was astounded to find that it was the hashtag of an October nerdfighter art prompt challenge that I did not know existed I found out about it through the trending tab on Twitter which I famously disliked but I suppose the product does deliver some useful information maybe not some maybe just one one piece of useful information which was the existence of the nerdfarters October nerdfighter art prompt challenge so the story is dftba Rachel had the idea ask people if they would be interested and then sweet Carolyn came along and said what if you called it nerd farters people were into it Rachel created this spooky graphic that had a different prompt for each of the 31 days in October we're almost halfway through the month and I wanted to share with you some of the genius that has been created and I hope that more will continue coming the first prompt was simply dftba which people went in a lot of different directions with and since it's the first one I'll go ahead and show you all of them that were submitted I won't do that for any of the other ones the great thing about this is no one is really trying to be a virtuoso except for Alice what the heck Alice now I'm not going to tell you any of my favorites of these but my favorite is obviously the one where I get chased by the crab with a knife our next prompt Pizza John yourself which is unexceptionally good prompt then we had Breezy fall day which is a reference to my second novel thank you for that followed by just the word Pelican on October 4th which is as delightful as you would expect next we have surprise fiddle concert which you could do anything with and then nerdfighteria and then pizzimus and then possibly my favorite prompt of the whole month draw a crab you have to do a bad job it is one thing to be told that you can do a bad job but I think that we need to require ourselves to do a bad job more often otherwise it's just too much pressure and you will never do the thing because you think you're bad at the thing but you can't get better at the thing if you don't do the thing going deeper into the lore here now we have French the llama and puppy-sized elephant then we got million dollar idea featuring surprisingly edible and the awesome club club which look I'm not saying we're gonna do that but I'm not saying that we aren't going to do it either then this Wednesday we had pumpkins and Penguins unsurprisingly full of delightful stuff including an actual pumpkin because it is indeed Halloween and then yesterday The Prompt was hope is the thing with feathers but I filmed this so early yesterday that there weren't any posted yet so if you want to see them you have to go look for the Nerdfighters hashtag on Twitter or follow nerdfarters on Twitter there were of course way too many nerd farts for me to post all of them in this video and it only seems to have been growing organically as the month has gone on and I very much hope that this video will inspire more people to go check it out maybe submit a couple prompts to yourself maybe you have to do a bad job I really love all the prompts I'm personally most looking forward to robot Carl that's exciting for me Superior fish beings is going to be amazing and also of course just I'm very excited to see your lemon man after all these years of doing this and all of the other things that we do I am very happy and excited to not be in control of many of the cool things that happen in this community I think and call me crazy that doing things is never about doing the best thing I think that it is about doing things and ideally doing things with people that you like a lot and who are cool and I am really feeling that energy right now having discovered this organically which is the strangest part like I'd seen a couple of Arts but I hadn't I hadn't like put it together that it was part of a thing until the hashtag just popped up which I guess is why they do the hashtag I just wish it wasn't constantly full of things that make me angry and sad but sometimes it's full of the thing that makes me happy and and what's the opposite of angry I don't know what's the opposite of angry I haven't figured it out let me know if you know what the opposite of angry is John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John in 2014 my social media was suddenly inundated with people telling me about and telling me to talk about solar freaking roadways an Indiegogo campaign that had been published by a company that was making roads that could good news solve every problem because look America is extremely paved there are so many roads and so many parking lots and so many more parking lots than you think there are if we were placed all of the paved area in the U.S with solar panels we would produce more power than the US uses which is a wild statistic that is completely irrelevant the list of reasons why solar roads are a bad idea is very long I will put an incomplete list on the screen right now I'll also put some links in the description but this video is not about why silver roads are a bad idea it's about why so many people thought they were a good idea in medicine or on the podcast sawbones you often hear that cure-alls cured nothing the human body and all the things that can go wrong with it are just too complex for there to be some magical simple solution that solves everything and as I re-watched that 2014 solar freaking roadways video the feeling I get is that the list of problems being solved is just too long they could improve drainage enhance playgrounds alert drivers to upcoming moose fixed the economy eliminate the need for fossil fuel melt snow Dick's power transmission and make partying more fun this is a video built to make people excited about something and since the average person doesn't know very much about how roads work we have people for that it's pretty easy to make a list of problems and then propose a solution that would solve all of them as long as you don't look too hard or know too much what this relies on is people not understanding how complex something that seems simple is and that's fine we're not supposed to nor can we know about everything I think this actually outlines a really important tension in society between like not wanting or being able to have everyone understand the intricacies of how tires interact with different paved surfaces at different levels of moisture and temperatures and speeds and also being frustrated by problems that we see and we see not getting fixed and then of course experts are annoyed when you're like why don't you just fix this problem and you're like well you don't want to know how complicated it is you don't want to know how tires work experts don't want to explain to you why you can't make highways out of glass but the division of expertise is like the number one thing that makes societies work but that stops working when there is no trust and stories of big Simple Solutions once they aren't implemented either rely on you realizing that it's more complicated or thinking that there's some super powerful cabal that's preventing us from doing the simple things which is why a lot of the times conversation about big Simple Solutions interfaces with conspiracy theory solar roadways are a big simple solution and I'm sorry but big Simple Solutions are very rare because everything is very complicated like soap may have been the last big Simple Solution so they do happen but it's been a while but honestly the reason I think this was a moment in a sort of Coney 2012 but two years later kind of way was a good impulse it was hopefulness like that was a hopeful moment we felt like the internet maybe could put an end to a Ugandan warlord or maybe even create a future where roads melted ice warned you about moose and generated more electricity than the cars that ran on them used maybe the problems weren't being solved because there wasn't enough hope or human excitement this was a wild time on the internet we did not know what was possible if only we hadn't found out the solar roadways people are actually still at it they've done some small scale installations and the way I see it it is an incremental value add for a very specific situations which get this is fine it's how almost everything gets done in this big messy complicated world because the big problems aren't there because evil people create them they are there because 8 billion people living together on a single planet is difficult and those big problems only ever really get solved in one situation and that's when lots of people with wildly varying areas of expertise trust each other and work together to solve them John I'll see you tomorrow good morning john so you know how covet 19 is a disease that is caused by sars cov2 which is a virus it feels like it would be better and simpler if we just called that the covid19 virus right so why don't we just do that well in the early 1900s doctors started noticing something weird about some different diseases they would sometimes have patients with shingles a really specific disease where you get a very painful rash on just one side of your body but then later those patients children would often come down with a totally different disease chickenpox which is like lots of different itchy bumps all over the body so they started to think that those two diseases might be caused by the same pathogen and they started to look for evidence of that after a lot of work in the 1950s it was finally confirmed separately in two different ways by two different scientists thomas huckleweller and evelyn nicole so this is one reason why we don't name viruses after the disease they cause indeed it looks like sarco v2 might kind of cause more than one disease there's covid19 and then there's like a blurry line between that and long coven if you want to know more about long covered we did an amazing scishow video about it i'll put a link in the doobly-doo the varicella zoster virus though which causes both shingles and chickenpox is a very clear-cut case children get chickenpox when they are infected by the varicella zoster virus and that happens either through droplets in the air or through exposure to the fluid from the rash or the bumps or more rarely they can get it from exposure to a person with the shingles rash which also contains the virus then almost all of the time quite quickly the child's immune system will fight off the disease and that virus will take refuge in your body for the rest of your life it finds a place to hide and that place is at the base of nerves near your spine and then as you get older your immune system might get weakened by stress or by medication or just by getting older and it will kind of forget about the herpes zoster virus and that will allow it to spring forth and infect the nerve at first that causes like tingling and then itching and then pain as the nerves get inflamed and this is why shingles almost always happens just on one side of the body in a specific area because it's the individual nerve that is having the infection the severity of the pain and discomfort from shingles which i can now personally attest to because i'm getting over a case right now feeling much better but it was very very bad it doesn't hurt anymore it just itches it's one of the reasons why we vaccinate almost all children against chickenpox in the u.s now this means far fewer kids are getting chickenpox and in the future they will be much less likely to get shingles as adults because you don't catch shingles shingles is in effect people might be mad at me for saying this like long chickenpox but other places that aren't the us are not vaccinating kids against chickenpox and the reason why is wild and may include my individual case of shingles in the u.s 95 of adults have had chickenpox which means that they could get shingles but only around one in three of them will but in 1995 we started to vaccinate pretty much every kid against chickenpox and cases of chickenpox among kids of course plummeted and that meant that younger people like me were less likely to be exposed to the virus from sick kids that exposure would be like a kind of natural vaccine that would work best for people in their 30s and 40s those people have fairly good immune systems they're also more likely to be around sick kids that would normally remind our immune systems to keep up the fight without those reminders the immune system is more likely to let the virus already in our bodies start to replicate and shingles slips through those cracks and that's especially the case when combined with immune suppressant medication and stress of which i have both so in effect i may have gotten shingles so that my son doesn't have to shingles rates kind of have to go up before they can go down rates of shingles and young people like me have indeed been on the rise though it doesn't seem to be affecting the rates of shingles in older people where it is more dangerous and that's also helped along by the fact that we now have a very effective shingles vaccine in addition to the separate chickenpox vaccine right now you can only get it if you're over 50 because it's in short supply but my guess is it will be available to younger people eventually this is just another example of how complicated disease and epidemiology and public health are it's just all complicated and hard to figure out and so i'm very grateful to all the people who are working to figure it out right now and to the people who have worked to figure it out in the past including evelyn nicole who was in her twenties when she first isolated the varicella zoster virus and who died of complications from covet 19 in 2020. john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so as you know i run a youtube company that makes educational videos and then gives them away it's not a super great business model but it does work most times the company continues to slowly grow making more things doing more stuff we have around 50 employees now you might find yourself asking how does that work and that's a great question i imagine complexly to be a project of nerdfighteria this is very much where complexly started and so if you are curious i would like to share how we make ends meet in this very new weird world first youtubers make 55 of the money that is made by the ads running on our content youtube also shares 55 of the money they make from youtube premium after their record labels take their cut which if you are curious turns out to be significantly more than an ad supported view but most people aren't signed up for premium so that's around three percent of complexity's revenue while youtube ads are around 28 number two grants a lot of people recognize that our content specifically crash course just generates a whole lot more value than it could ever capture like maybe millions of times more value and some of those people are wealthy or they work for wealthy people or institutions they want people to have access to great resources and so they give us money to make them now grants do sometimes have strings attached some are extra stringy but we always make it very clear that they can give us input and give us ideas but we are in charge of what gets created now this can fluctuate a ton from year to year but last year grants were responsible for about the same amount of revenue as youtube was at 29 coming in at just under 20 is crowdfunding so because people know that basically everything that we do is not sustainable given the current business models of internet content they give us money either through our patreons or through the crash course i think everybody supports things for different reasons but i think there's like a mix of like a selfish thing where like i want this content to exist so i will pay for it and more of a selfless thing which is that like i will pay for this so that all people can have access to it now crowdfunding does not come with any strings at all where advertising or grants could so not only does it make our stuff possible i think it makes it better because we get to make all the choices fourth at fourteen percent of our revenue we also sell our own ads so like policy genius on dear hank and john or curiosity stream on scishow that comes out of our internal sales team it's more of a pain in the butt but the ad rates are higher and we don't have to split it with anybody number five we also license our content to various platforms like it's all available for free but some people want our content like curiosity stream has a lot of crash course on it and we get paid for that altogether all of the licensing last year was about five percent of the company's revenue and last at two percent which is not nothing but it is two percent is physical product just bringing high quality things that provide value into people's lives like the micro cosmos microscope which i'm looking at but you can't see and we'd like to do more stuff like that which is why get this we are selling five calendars for five of our shows the eons and bizarre beasts calendars features the best of the original art created for those shows the micro cosmos calendar features the microphotography of james weiss our master of microscopes and the scishow and scishow space calendars just showcase the variety and beauty of our world and of worlds in our solar system every calendar is printed on high quality people in the us they ship everywhere and they feature not just beautiful images but also lots of interesting facts about those images because we cannot stop ourselves from sharing how cool the world is every show it complexly has a really different mix of how it makes itself sustainable some of our shows don't break even for a pretty long time some of them never do and we end up canceling them and it's hard and it's weird and it often feels like we don't know what we're doing but there's a reason for that which is that no one's done this before like companies like this didn't exist 10 years ago when complexity started we're just very busy trying things out seeing what works just using the talents and skills of people on the team to make things that are great and that we think people will like so how about this i come back next year and i tell you whether or not that two percent changed because maybe you needed a calendar and we made some great ones and they are available at complexitycalendars.com john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i just discovered that the way people used to ask the science side of tumblr questions people very very occasionally ask the science side of twitter questions so i just searched for science side of twitter and i'm going to answer as many questions as they can in four minutes are constellations different in the southern hemisphere like is the big dipper and the zodiac down there the constellations themselves don't change but you can see different ones depending on where you are on earth if you were on the north pole and the earth's axis weren't tilted then you could only ever see just the top half of the constellations and same for the south pole now it's a little complicated because it's tilting so your perspective actually changes a little bit throughout the year but if you're right on the equator as the year goes by you can actually see almost all of the sky though a lot of it will be really close to the horizon so hard to see if you find this confusing it's because it's very confusing the earth is revolving while it's rotating and we're also thinking about us being in different places on a rotating and revolving thing there are some people who get their heads all the way around this but they think about it for a living how do i stop look i don't know i have been told that you need an equal and opposite force i haven't found one yet but i have been assured that they exist what are these giant quasar looking stars though that's just a star that is in our galaxy all those background things in this image those are galaxies that are like billions of miles away so it's literally millions of times closer so it looks a lot brighter and super bright stuff when seen by the james webb space telescope has these diffraction spikes which is caused by the shape of the mirror how many calories on average do you burn taking a massive dump i mean not zero interestingly the anus is a muscle that is almost always contracting um and so it's always burning energy until it is loosened in that case it's burning less energy but i think that that's more than outweighed by a lot of other muscle contractions that are probably going on during the dump plus you know any anxiety you might be experiencing i might also burn a little extra calories why does ketchup have to be refrigerated isn't it primarily vinegar salt and sugar all of which are preservative fascinating question when we talk about preserving foods we're talking about two different things one is preventing bacteria from growing in it which is going to spoil it and make it dangerous high concentrations of vinegar salt and sugar will all prevent bacterial growth but we are also concerned about the complicated molecules in the food stuff breaking down into other molecules that might just taste less good once the ketchup is exposed to a good deal of oxygen those reactions are going to happen more quickly and so we want to slow them down and one way to do that is by having less heat in the system so putting it in the refrigerator hey science twitter any tips for reducing eye strain when using a microscope using a microscope is absolutely a lot of this which is like hunch and eye stream so i suggest you get one of these which the micro cosmos microscope comes with it's a cell phone holder you put the eyepiece in here and then you clamp your cell phone in here and you put it on and you're looking through your microscope like there's a screen now you do have to be able to choose which lens your cell phone is looking through which the iphone doesn't let you do by default there are apps that let you do that though the one i use is called procam and this one is specifically for me how did i get an actual brain freeze without consuming any liquids purely from pouring cold water over my face so a brain freeze is a kind of nerve pain it's your brain misinterpreting a confusing signal getting suddenly cold will cause all the blood vessels near your nerves to contract and then when they warm back up very quickly they will open back up and that will cause a flood of blood to the area that will just be confusing to the nervous system and in your face and head all these sensory nerves are really closely packed together so it's just more common for signals to get confused i think i haven't heard of this happening before but it totally seems like something that could happen does sound travel in outer space sound is just a bunch of molecules slapping into each other so you need a bunch of molecules really densely packed together to carry that signal in an atmosphere we have that this is actually pretty thick soup of molecules right here in space there are basically no molecules so they can't knock into each other to carry sound which is a good thing because the sun is so energetic that if space carried sound as well as our atmosphere it would be a constant 100 decibel roar that we would never not experience what's a good time to wake up my friends because my phone is dying and i need my charger block from their room what you're gonna want to do is get two potatoes and a copper wire and i'm kidding i've just looked at your tweet from 2 27 a.m you don't need to be on twitter anymore bedtime it's bedtime john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John in August of 2019 the New York Times published an article that was titled why hate speech on the Internet is a never-ending problem because this law Shields the law in question was section 230 of the communications decency act later that day they published The Following retraction an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the law that protects hate speech on the internet the First Amendment not section 230 of the communications decency act protects it now this is kind of funny it's also kind of not especially if you know the long history of people misunderstanding section 230 and what it means it is very difficult for all of us to figure out how to adjust to the power that the internet wields and when we're doing that it's pretty easy to look toward what's probably the most important piece of legislation in the history of the internet which was passed as part of a much larger bill when Mark Zuckerberg was 11 years old and then when he was 12 years old almost all of that law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court but they left one section section 230 which says among other things this no provider or user of an interactive Computer Service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider to explain right now I am the other information content provider and YouTube is the provider of the interactive Computer Service and so if I slander someone or try to recruit someone to my terrorist cell or otherwise do something illegal you can sue or find or imprison me you can't hold YouTube liable for what I said this thing section 230 is kind of what made it possible for the many to many internet thing to exist which is good but also bad it's the thing that we love about the internet and it's the thing that we hate about the internet right now the Supreme Court is hearing a case against YouTube that argues that YouTube is not liable for the content in the videos on its platform but it is liable for the recommendations of that content to people if the YouTube algorithm recommends terrorist recruitment videos to YouTube users it isn't just hosting content it's also kind of creating a new kind of content which is the recommendation and that seems a little bit right to me the problem though is where do you draw the line for what counts as a recommendation is a Google search a list of recommendations that Google is making to me does that mean that every internet platform that has a recommendation system of any kind meaning all of them are they liable for what they recommended if they are does the internet work at all it looks like the Supreme Court will not find YouTube liable in this case which I think is good but the reality is that there is something of a difference between the front page of YouTube being algorithmically generated for each individual user and me searching for something and getting recommended results and maybe there's a difference between those two things and chat GPT creating content that I will then read that was nonetheless created by a machine there's definitely a way to see recommendation as creation I just don't think that a law passed in 1996 did a good job of anticipating that and actually I think that that law had a tremendous amount of foresight and has served us fairly well there was a moment when the Supreme Court was talking about this when Justice Kagan said something that I want to play for you now you know every other industry has to internalize the costs of misconduct why is it that the tech industry gets a pass on the other hand I mean we're a court we really don't know about these things you know these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet the implication being we probably shouldn't be trying to figure this stuff out based on 26 words that were written in 1996. it should be decided by passing new legislation that considers the internet as it exists now which is pretty different from when there are interactive Computer Services I think that we're actually pretty dang lucky that section 230 supported the creation of this new tool of many-to-many communication which has I admit drawbacks but I don't think anybody's figured out like a good and simple way to tease all the bad parts out from the good parts and the times that we've attempted to do that haven't had great outcomes it's very hard to legislate for a world that changes this quickly so if it feels sometimes like we don't know how to do this it's because we don't know how to do it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John and welcome to the project for awesome 2023 meme review during the project for awesome people make things and then they submit them to the project for awesome art folder including this music that you're hearing right now from ickle there was a whole album of techno vlogbrother stuff I'm still pretty hyped for awesome and the two cups of black tea that I just had five count them five folders on my desktop that I have filled with stuff relying on the fact that I have two years in a row gotten permission to make extra long videos I'm gonna do that starting of course since it's a meme review with the folder labeled memes just like the project for awesome there is no Rhyme or Reason to this you just start somewhere in the middle and you put the peeps in the bean can and add the Dr Pepper all these powerful white men are are laughing at John Green because they put the Dr Pepper on Peeps and at that point you have to do it I don't know if I've said this before but I actually wrapped like gift wrapped the peeps and it said project for awesome day one open on day one and then my son thought it was a present for him and he opened it at John house and just started eating them sound financial decisions and me being held back by sending two middle-aged guys to a restaurant it's twenty dollars and we are gonna make it worth it everywhere I go I see his face look I'm not necessarily proud I did buy way too many oh geez I just spilled pickle juice on myself it wasn't totally sealed well I do still have my paper towels because it's project for awesome and the most important thing is paper look at how many paper towels I used let's just all take a moment to be grateful for Catherine green anyway I bought too many pickles as all I wanted to say just putting beans in the bean home I've got a bean shirt on and a banana Loca in one hand and a corn dog in the other any cylindrical food is on the table I did buy hot dogs this year and I didn't end up using them next year project for awesome audience just watching me slapping Dr Pepper baked beads on an unsuspecting pickle Hank Green slurping Dr Pepper beans from a banana Loca doesn't exist and can't hurt you oh yeah you think so and I had to get them out somehow I don't know I feel like everyone was having a good time and I stand by the fact that a Twinkie filled with Dr Pepper baked beans is better than a Twinkie knot filled with Dr Pepper baked beans this is in reference to the auction that we had for Ryan Reynolds Deadpool screen worn watch me and Ray were in a tight battle and then Ben came out of the last second Chow this is great because it does look like he's joking but he is not joking Dustin was responsible for the largest single hour of the project for awesome this year support the project for Awesome by watching the live stream by voting on videos by donating by getting married and moving to North Dakota that's a deep cut but that was a fun part of the stream guests are ready signal strong donation steady made a donation to the project already Hank's confetti if you got the confetti perk I've ordered some special stickers to close these up with I'm just waiting on that and then they'll go out to you me before crabilis me after I get a premium subscription to have a crab in my inbox every month I love this because I know the screen cap that this video is from because Oren and I watch it together all the time and we dance Captain Crunch Gotta Love any amount of Darcy that gets into the memes me and John on both crunched a lemon and it was bad both times crunch uh looking at Darcy crunching a carrot instead of me crunching a lemon and look I don't know I feel like I put more into that than Darcy did you can't defeat me humans I know but she can that's right Darcy crunching carrots was responsible for us breaking through the two million dollar barrier this wasn't like the first moments of the project for awesome where I was like I guess it's begun I'm gonna make a hole in the bottom of a peep that's Dr Pepper flavor and filled with beans we didn't have to hit a goal to get there or anything I just couldn't stop myself and I don't know that John liked it for every ten thousand dollars we will reward Darcy with carrots Nerdfighters Max Max Max so his spaceship is very good friendship ended with beans now hummus is my best friend we that was the first mention of hummus of this whole meme review I don't know if anybody was happy to see the banana Loca come back weirdly I now have two because I was gifted one by a friend who didn't know I had one who knew that I would want one so I'm like this in real life I a little bit like the part where you don't like it like you have to know that right I tried to Crunch a carrot as good as Darcy I don't actually think I did I think I did a worse job so the story behind the hummus is that it turns out one of the stock notification sounds in slack is just a woman saying a hummus I changed it because people donated for me to change it and I left it that way for the entire project for rasa but I did mute the more active slack channels and before I did that there was a lot of hummus happening it was a little overwhelmed yeah like this and like that and like that doing 20 on something I need spending twenty dollars so two guys can go to a racks I don't know if you needed that but I think that we all needed that yeah they knew ultimately it is a little hard for it not to be a problem tummy time the project for awesome but we work through it I'm gonna donate for a perk that is so being filled you don't actually get any Bean filled perks that's not that's not available yet maybe next year adding a citrus crunching a almond I don't know if it was supposed to be lemon but it says Ramen and that's great never ask a woman her age a man his salary Hank wear the slip of paper from the balloon win I never found it maybe it's like in one of these cracks or it like flew into the bookshelf somewhere I never found it someday I will we had to vote on who the mascot of the 2023 project for awesome lesson T-Rex clobbered hummus Lemon Lips man was the other option uh it wasn't even close this is great because the meme is referencing itself fantastic work John cannot be quiet about tuberculosis at the moment but God bless him for it John I love you for who you are oh yeah when I crunch the limb and my lips swelled up and I looked like this guy from Monsters Inc also last year I had to pretend to be a crab this year I had to pretend to be a cute little housefly and both times it definitely hurt my knees I did decide that the phone a friend task was too easy so I taped my phone to my phone which also might be part of the reason why my knee hurts this is part of the story of this year's project for awesome we decide like we had to commit the bit we had to make it a priority it's been too long we've talked about racks and not been to a racks we're gonna go to Rex which might be a problem for our pants but we're gonna do it anyway are we gonna talk about why Rax is bad for your pants it's very deep it's too deep it's time to go was I a good restaurant no you ruined pants I don't even really know where it came from this is great because it's destined on the moon and he's Mr T which is tuberculosis racks T-Rex is as well hello the moon you can eat here it's everything it's got everything all at once marked safe from beans on a peeps you're not you're never safe the two Vibes of the project for awesome are a little bit contradictory but I think they come together very well someone accidentally bid 42 000 for the watch and we had to roll it back but luckily we were able to do that stay up to date on your vaccinations the internet's hottest club is the p4a live stream this place has everything Bean filled pickles the word hummus fast food restaurant chain rack honestly that list could have gone on way longer and not gotten any less weird big Lemon Lips a Furby made of beans and dinosaurs going to the Moon if you don't know about Stefan this doesn't make sense but that's okay who would win famous science educator or a puzzle of electric rap the puzzle of the electric rat one I actually found the piece that I couldn't find after the stream ending you think you're gonna get beans no you mostly get slack hummus and beans though baked beans no lemons no lemon baked beans I put a little bit of lemon juice in the Dr Pepper baked beans and it was way it was so good it was way better it needed something to cut that sugar is there a world where I could give Paul Hollywood a pickle stuffed with baked beans because I feel like that would be an achievement Destin kept saying tataria which I understand it looks like tataria now that I'm looking at it to ataria is how it's pronounced I like that spaceship that's a nice spaceship sorry you're memeing the concept of hummus and it was a good mascot maybe just not the best they are both the p4re I cannot disagree Hey look it's the part where I had my phone taped to my foot and I called my friend Joe just drowning in hummus I couldn't make it out who would win one Hank Green or one lemon boy one lemon boy would win oh no was I just whining about my knee the whole time I'm sure I was and that's the end that's the end of the memes everybody time to move on to the next folder none of them are going to be anywhere as long as the memes but we do have one folder that's just called hummus this almost ended up in the art folder because it's beautiful oh my God it's hummus hummus Hank trying to raise money for charity the trains coming by it says Hamas listening for hummus by Hank Green special 16th anniversary edition number one inside joke for nerdfighteria of project for awesome 2023 evocative hummus meme Iraq's being dipped into hummus this person knitted a hummus thing hummus we're hummus because we're hummus and finally a hummus Furby and not the last one you'll see today what's our next folder called you ask it's called T-Rex and it's just rack stuff this is a baby picture of me taking the place of another child who was in a racks commercial deep cut well done Mr

why I have so many tattoos racks you can eat here endless hummus bar this folder is just lemon stuff but there's only four things in it I think I got confused halfway through but here it is this is a lemon crab saying hummus and I think it's crank green so it's also me if only it we're also a dinosaur I didn't feel bad for the lemon before but I do a little bit now you don't have to understand that joke but there it is and finally this it's a crab with lemon lips and my glasses and it's got my press on nails turns out impossible to play guitar with the press on nails on your string fingers and we cap it all off with the last folder on my desktop this one is just labeled art it's just art it's things that were too beautiful for me to It's called The memes including me as a house fly that's a little bit too well done it's kind of freaking me out I'm giant I'm not a cute little fly I'm a big scary fly I'm a big scary flying man I have a lot of little hairs I would love to get into carrot business just so we can make organic Darcy crunch carrots um good be weird do good if that's not the project for awesome I don't know what is for at some point I pretended to be a crab while doing Shakespeare I forgot about that until this moment this is just my very large face with the word beans superimposed over it because this is becoming my brand Eternal salad bar what a beautiful but creepy racks very Twin Peaks Justin going to the Moon in his spaceship car five foot nine brown eyes and a sundress which is just a Deering and John joke it's this that's nothing to do with the project for us I don't know if many people would buy hummus if this was The Branding but I know that I would we have to stop saying now we're cooking with gas we need to stop cooking with gas and it's not even as good as solar powered induction I could definitely see this on a t-shirt but then you'd have to explain it to people hummus somebody made a winter project for awesome cookies there's T-Rex there's crunching there's a bean pickle there's crank green look delicious really lovely we're here because we are here spiral I don't know how you do that that well little darsiered watercolor a little crabulous 2.0 no watercolor a little Lemon Lips watercolor tuberculosis focused Endeavor project for awesome staple with lemon crunch panic attack John Green a rabbit hole crunch it's beautiful we're hummus because we're hummus also a thing that happened a crab with the longest eyelashes you've ever seen and a feather boa and some big old lips beautiful project for awesome mandala again another quite creepy Rex image it's starting to feel kind of threatening with the Eternal salad bar this color pencil T-Rex is so huge he's got a head of hair which you just don't see on dinosaurs very often many of these things seem like they would have taken more than two days to do but I don't know I don't like I don't know how I've never made anything like this I have no idea how hard it is to make but it seems very difficult Lemon Lips no hips that's me Hank Green a bean peep a bunch of dogs pee for a you can cry here it's in the founding documents it's not required but it is encouraged I mean we did the coffee club we did the sock Club what's next this is gorgeous and must have taken a very long time had to be more than just a project for us a project for awesome vision board you just keep cramming stuff in because more weird things are gonna happen this is so cute he's wonderful that's art right I don't like what am I supposed to say T-Rex eating hummus and destroying pants will Darcy carrot very cute Tony orange I couldn't remember Ted lasso's name and I knew that his last name was a noun that's what my brain was telling me okay if you look very closely Mr delicious is inside of this T-Rex he's swearing the nerdfighteria turned 16 this year so it's got a driver's license of course and just so you know it is an organ donor be gay moved to North Dakota self-care is

Pizza Man and I guess Bean boy I don't know what else to oh no don't forget I said it Dustin's given a press conference two just to notice a bunch of dinosaurs I did break an egg over my head I did immediately regret it maybe they were trying to predict that I would write butts on my head but I didn't Sharpie face at all this yes it's a beautiful self-care bunny well I love you card and there's a crank green inside of it down in the bottom of the heart so cute another doodle Board of things going on you are on earth and no one can take that away from you Hank Green's hunky chasa 100 a profit

because we're here p4a2023 dftba crunch I love this triangle in the middle of the rainbow it's really pretty I don't know what to say about this what's up with the giant space dinosaur I don't know it's going to the Moon obviously this is so great I love this it's so adorable dinosaurs in space Gumball Mike of course John Green getting Sharpie faced into from like a sort of Sigmund Freud character here all the way to a very punk rock figure and then there's Hank Green Lemon Lips no hips again this is very good but literally no hips in this situation and I love that p4a logo you made you are a Dino on the moon and no one can take that away from you and green in my new book The anthropubine refilled build can Edition my goodness and then the beans in my pickle by crank Green Oh I think all these were done by the same person so I don't know who it was but thank you it was genius crotch Tony orange again P for a plus I think that's basically the uh the digital download bundle AS p4a Plus and then of course there's this hanger fish crunching a lemon he's lovely and he's made a mistake certainly one of the greatest pieces of project for awesome art this year was these two long Furbies one is a lemon hummus long Furby and the other is a bean pickle long Furby with the crack in it that the beans are coming out of which did happen to my pickle it's not really anything more perfect than that I bought this as a sticker and I'm gonna put it on my laptop because I love my life we're hummus because we're a lemon crab with gigantic lips a lot of people make little compilation images of their whole weekend I love them this was a nice one a nice little Lemon Lips logo I had the Lemon Lips John Green watercolor sketch this little baby meeting it's Mommy strong sad with a crab playing with them you can't explain but it was a nice moment I really feel like it was the road to racks like it's a video game level one we have to fight that giant Dr Pepper peep then we gotta fight the bean pickle then we gotta fight the Lemon Lips and then we gotta fight just a bunch of coffee beans because at one point I did just eat raw coffee beans and then last you gotta fight Tyrannosaurus Rex cause it turns out maybe a lot of the beauty Aesthetics of that time came from thinking that people with consumption were extra hot it froze on John's face when he was making that frowny face he was it was like that for like a full 30 seconds and it was such a perfect meme face it's absolutely beautiful so you could just drink cap that for any any use that you want we're here because we're here but it spells out hummus raising nerdy to the power of awesome be weird do good and it's a T-Rex at the Rex new item Lemon Lips and it's just roaring out hummus and finally the first piece of art I saw and the last one I will show you today is this 3D art of beans stuffed inside of a Dr Pepper pea it was a truly magical project for awesome there were so many ridiculous beautiful memorable moments there was this I'll never forget that it was like I did a magic trick but I none of it was on purpose not even the confetti stuck to the balloon there are a lot of ways to find meaning and purpose in this world but the project for awesome is one that we kind of made up from scratch and it is just ever so good I'm so grateful to all of you who were a part of it in whatever way you were and of course I'm also very grateful to you John we had a really good time it was a good old time and now now I have to figure out how to take all my lights down without getting them all tangled and John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John doing something a little different today it's officially countdown time to project for us I set this video to Premiere so theoretically there are a bunch of people watching all at once right now and they're all in the chat together just chanting butt farting butt Fartman butt Fartman over and over again trying to summon him we'll see if that works if you don't know who butt Fartman is or beanie sandverbs or crank green or Dave the fish or Glenn of the Glenn and Dale of the Dale don't worry that's okay they're all mascots of former projects for awesome not this one what's gonna be the mascot of this project for awesome no one knows you don't know until you start and then immediately I turn into a crab for some reason and this happens which is great no one doesn't like this I didn't even realize we were making mascots for the project for awesome until last year after we had had like over a dozen of them and I don't remember the origin stories they all have origin stories if you're gonna read any of them you should read butt fartman's [Music] excellent well done everyone you can stop chanting now you successfully summoned him now in the chat or in comments if you're late you could just type in the best parts of the project for awesome according to you now you'd think that a 48-hour live stream dedicated to fixing the unfixable problems of humanity and Earth would not be so goofy this is actually something I've noticed quite a bit if you sort of know about the problems and you look at the problems and you say oh that's problem is problem that is somber it's not fun but in the moments when I see people actually working on hard problems ideally together in community with others the recognition of the magnitude of the problem is still there that didn't go away but also it just becomes human community and human Community is all of the things that humans always are whether that is silly or goofy or sad or serious or depressed or anxious or joyful or whatever it's not joyful in spite of the fact that it's directly interfacing with you know some of the greatest challenges that Humanity has to face it's joyful because it isn't like glancing at those things and then being ashamed that they exist it's just accepting that they are and that nothing can ever be perfect but we can work hard and when we work together we can magnify our impact which this year is already building off of over seven hundred thousand dollars in matching grants so if we can raise seven hundred thousand dollars during the project for awesome all of those initial dollars will be matched and we will be at 1.4 million dollars so recognizing the flaws in our world and then witnessing our combined impact yeah it's gonna be a little bit joyful and then you add in the sleep deprivation and you know you get what you get so during the first half of the project for awesome we will again be raising money for Partners in Health and save the children these are two organizations that work to make life better for some of the people who have the very least on our planet and they both do it in ways that build strong foundations for those communities the idea being that those people want to work hard for themselves and their families and their communities they want to help each other out there are things that weigh on those communities lack of Access to Health Care and education not having enough food or clean water we know from evidence from experience that if you give people the resources and a strong foundation on which to build they will build during the second half of the project for awesome the money will go to registered non-profits that are voted on by this community so we divide that up and we split it amongst 20 to 30 non-profits depending on how much we rate people all over have made videos talking about the great work that non-profits that they know about do those videos were submitted to project for awesome.com we'll watch some of them during the live stream but you can also just watch them on the website now and if you like the pitch you could vote on the Charities at project for awesome.com donate you will find a little rewards button you'll click on that and there'll be a lot of rewards you can scroll and scroll and find all the different things that are available and they're very good there's so much and we will talk about all of it at project for awesome.com live which is where you should go the moment this video ends which is right now John I'll see you there good morning John uh there's something about this isn't there Catherine turned to me after finishing your video from this week and she said I was engaged but I was relaxed I think the way we normally do these videos like isn't precisely that I mean I'm not gonna stop doing it this way I like this way this is the way this is the way but I don't think it's relaxing and like I'm getting older maybe the level of energy needs to come down a little bit sometimes a hamstring has to be the most ridiculously named muscle right there can't be a worse one than that Cath is weird like it's just uh somebody looked at that and was like that looks like a small cow but at least kath is like a living animal if it were called a veal string then I'd be like yeah that's equally ridiculous to hamstring that's that's the basic of the situation we're in with hamstring that's got to be the weirdest one I've been working on project for awesome perks because it's uh it's going up quick for the last four or five years we've been making various kinds of spray paint art where we've been using stencils on glass or canvas and when we were doing that we also made something by accident every year I used the same roll of paper as the drop cloth so he wouldn't get paint on whatever surface we were painting on and over the years that paper became really beautiful like it had all the stencil marks and then it had scuffs and Footprints and some of it started to rip and it was just like clear that we weren't going to use this paper again and and I literally like looked down at it in the dumpster and I was like I I can't throw that away I took it home and I cut out squares uh and then I graffiti mopped hangler fish on a bunch of them and they are the hanger fish art this year and they're all signed and numbered there's 250 of them and I'm excited to share them with people and of course it's the only time we're going to be able to do ones like this because that paper doesn't exist anymore it's a pretty good trade though I think and next year I'll have to figure out something else to do I'm not sure if that's not an optimistic or depressing um but I guess that's what figuring out something else to do is both of those things so I have a friend she's a pretty good friend and I go over to her place fairly frequently um and uh and she knows my name which is weird that I mentioned that go over to her place once to to meet a new member of her family she's got a new dog it's extremely cute brand new dog didn't exist a couple months ago and she's like this is Hank meet Hank uh what what am I supposed to do with this like either this is an odd honor that is being bestowed on me or you forgot I existed this isn't a dog that came from the pound with a name this is a new dog that you had an infinite number of names that you could have given I'm not personally a name dogs human names kind of person I my dog was named lemon my cats have been named Cameo and gummy bear we don't run into that problem very often when someone shows up and they're like oh my name's gummy bear too you can do it I just think like avoid the names of people who are going to be at your house a lot and soon sorry it's true if you're watching this um just know that I never said anything and then it just sort of pinged around in there for years until this I forgot about gluteus maximus gluteus maximus is definitely the most ridiculous name for a gluteus maximus like your butt is the emperor of Rome gluteus maximus runs [Music] and [Music] I like to say if it ain't folk don't Blix it it's just funnier John I'll see you tomorrow good morning John surprise it's me I'm here on the channel I thought I was getting a colonoscopy today but it turns out that I'm not you'd think that's something I would know I scheduled one and then I started a new medicine and then they wanted to push it back but then I didn't take it off my schedule so I have one in May it's fine you don't need to know but that means I had a whole extra day which is great because I have a lot to do put on a presentation about titles and thumbnails thinking about redesigning my office I got a couple of updates I need to send out to the community here project for awesome is coming I think I might have like a mild existential crisis about halfway through the day I need to get lunch at some point I might just make a sandwich first the subscriptions system that we use to run the awesome socks club and coffee and also Pizza Miss stuff they had a weird glitch so it may have sent you an email that you're gonna get skipped for this month you won't uh we're working on a fix uh sorry that shouldn't happen again as a man once said still some glitches to work out and I really am grateful because people are so understanding when stuff like this happens so thanks for that I'm so excited about how well those things have done we've got you know thousands of people getting coffee every month and tens of thousands of people getting socks every month it makes me think a lot about what's possible and thinking a lot about what's possible these days often requires me to think about what is impossible which is me doing more stuff which is a shame because I very much love to do more stuff I'm sure that's something no one's ever noticed about me also the project for awesome is approaching rapidly February 17th and video submissions are open we used to do it everybody would upload the video on the same day YouTube doesn't really care about that anymore so you can upload it beforehand get it into our system and then we can review the videos and pick out ones that we might want to feature during the project for awesome live stream so if you want to make your project for awesome video do that and then submit it at project for awesome.com if you don't know what I'm talking about the project for awesome is a yearly 48-hour live stream that John and I and friends have been doing since 2007. we raise money we send people things in exchange for that money both physical and digital things there's a whole campaign that will be live during the live stream during the first half we raise money for save the children and Partners in Health and during the second half we raise money for organizations voted on by the community and we decide that by watching videos that people make talking about the great work that organizations they care about do in their community and in the world so if you want to make a video supporting your favorite charity you can do that it doesn't have to be more than a minute long tell us about the problem that organization is interfacing with why it's a big deal and how they're trying to solve that problem that's that's the basic format of most YouTube videos about anything what is the problem why is it important what should we do about it that's so much of what humans do and it's a good format it's a reason why we do things that way I don't know which of the things that I do is the most important one or even which one I enjoy the most so that's like a weird thing for a bunch of chemical reactions to think I'm also going to be doing the nerdfighteria census fairly soon so if you haven't filled out the survey there's a link in the description to do that so that we can get more data about how people are feeling about nerdfighteria it's good to get a broad base of information from all across this community so that's in the description as well and what else is going on Catherine and I have been having a good old time with delete this lately we kind of fell into a new format called wet or dry where we talk about one wet thing and one dry thing and then try and figure out which of the things is better it sounds like a terrible idea for a podcast but it's maybe my best idea for a podcast ever it's very fun and it's been very silly it maybe is not for kids though just FYI I mostly mentioned that so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening and hydrogen isn't it interesting that there is an element where if you take away the electron it's just a proton it's still hydrogen that's how it works elements are defined by the number of protons they have and hydrogen has one proton so if there's just one proton it's hydrogen that's cool I don't know why it takes me out of the frame a little bit additional thing to share Hank's Channel got one of these so that see that's you right there you see yourself that's you that's what you look like to me it's not how I think of you anyway I have no idea which of the things that I just said is going to fit in this video definitely not all of it that's for sure John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John one thing I think people sense but I don't say that often is that I feel a pretty strong obligation to do good and interesting things with the tools that I have and probably the two most impactful uh things that I have easy access to are one this audience this group of people this community who have supported a lot of very good and interesting things over the years and then the second probably most powerful tool is the people who work at and the things that have been made by complexly all of the things I have been referring to as tools are human beings but yeah I hope you understand what I mean crash course in particular has become a pretty interesting thing in the world of educational media which has resulted in lots of people like knock it on our doors to see if they can invest or partner with us in various ways a lot and to figure out what to do with an asset like that all you really have to do is to sort of understand the entire problem landscape of all of global education so that should be fine but a few years back we did decide to start walking down a road like this and it did start with a lot of trying to figure out what the problems that students in the US in particular face how to imagine those barriers and how to lower them obviously I don't know much about that I'm a YouTuber with a background in Biochemistry so it involved talking to a lot of people who are actually in higher education because we wanted to have a kind of thing that sort of supported people on their Bridge from high school to college in the U.S so for a little bit of context right now at a state school it costs about twelve hundred dollars for a three credit course you can also get credits while you are in high school but sometimes those credits don't transfer indeed lots of these credits don't transfer easily from school to school and figure out when and how they do is a big messy mess and that is just one part of the big messy mess that is the entire education bureaucracy that is more complicated if you have fewer resources and also you probably have less access to information or fewer people who are around you who've been through the system before so as we were doing our research we identified that as actually one of the main barriers that some people just don't know a lot about how this system works and that can result in costly mistakes the other like main big barrier though which is the one that people most often cite when they drop out of school is cost it's just that it costs a lot of money at some point in the last five years some folks at YouTube introduced us to some folks at Arizona State University which is a large public research University with a specific goal of judging itself not by like its rejection rates and how exclusive they are but by how many people they can include in their school so after a lot of conversations and a lot of work from a lot of people we ended up with a thing that's called study hall study hall has like four main parts right now there's fast guides which is like a guide to what different college majors are about what they do for you what people end up doing usually once you get them how to college which is just a crash course on how College Works College foundations which are videos that cover foundational college courses that tons of people have to take and finally a thing that just launched this week at gostudyhall.com which is a way of going from those College foundations course to an actual course that you're taking online that you can get transferable college credit for from Arizona State University the videos are of course still free on YouTube but if you want to take the course you start out by paying 25 once you've signed up and the course Begins the first one begins on March 7th you could take the class with a cohort of students with faculty support and at the end of the course if you think that the course did a good job of teaching you and you like the grade that you got you can pay 400 for a transferable college credit so basically we're providing an option to get foundational course knowledge and transferable credits from a major research institution with more flexibility and at a lower cost and like I kind of can't believe that's real the goal is not to replace college with YouTube videos it's to look closely at the barriers and lower the ones that we can I wish we could fix the whole system with one sweeping action but as long as we can't do that we gotta do what we can with what we have so if you know folks that might be interested in this please tell them about it and of course thank you so much to the dozens of people who have been working on this in one way or another for years now who are at complexly or ASU or at YouTube I'm so proud of the work that we've done and I'm so excited to have it out there John I'll see you on Tuesday not making a video next week instead I'm gonna get a colonoscopy so just so you know that ah my goodness good morning John so I've noticed that for the last few videos you are basically doing just whatever I am doing I did low budget Bo Burnham you did a low budget Bo Burnham I did a Google autofill thing you did a Google autofill thing I think this is cheating or at least lazy and so I am going to make it hard for you by taking you behind the scenes to one of the most advanced aquarium exhibits in the whole world I actually got to tour this exhibit before it actually existed to see the complexity of what makes it all come together because you'd think okay an aquarium on the coast that can't be that complicated pump seawater in put fish in the sea water and it's beautiful well it is more complicated than that than three years ago I actually made a whole video about it and you can watch it but not all ocean is the same in particular it's very different at different depths and there are animals in the deep sea that basically no one gets to see it's extremely hard to go down there it's also hard to get the animals to the surface and once they're at the surface the sea water is so different from the water of the deep sea that they cannot survive in it but at the mount Monterey Bay Aquarium they wanted people to be able to walk amongst the animals of the deep sea just to exist in the same space system and if you go to that exhibit which I have not been able to do yet you can do just that you are in the dark walking through Halls surrounded by animals that typically inhabit the most difficult to visit place on Earth and it is designed to appear to the people walking through the exhibit that that's all fairly effortless it's just something for you to enjoy not for you to understand the engineering behind how it is possible but before the exhibit opened I got to see how that seemingly effortless cohabitation between humans and deep sea animals is actually extremely complicated and fairly precarious so look when I walked into this I thought the hardest part of this process was going to be pressurizing the water to the same pressures as the deep sea because water is very heavy and down at the bottom of the ocean there is a lot of water on top of you enough pressure to very easily kill you but I you know I need to exist at a certain pressure of atmospheric pressure in order to exist and the difference between the ocean pressure at the bottom of the sea and the ocean pressure at the top of the sea is bigger than the difference between air pressure at sea level and space but many deep sea creatures don't have very much gas inside of them so if you bring them up slowly enough they'll be fine so if you don't actually have to pressurize the water what's the concern the trouble is that the sea water itself is different it has higher salinity very consistent low temperature and really consistent gas concentrations that are very different from surface level water and so behind every wall at into the deep there are systems that take water from Monterey Bay and turn it into a simulation of deep sea water and it turns out the hardest part of this is removing the perfect amount of oxygen oxygen is great but it is also a super reactive molecule and these animals are used to an environment with a super low oxygen concentration the oxygen of surface sea level would absolutely kill many of them and so all of the water in this aquarium must be run through a equipment that was designed I'm not kidding for Semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing among other things situations where they really need to control the amount of different chemicals present in a system by running the water over tons of tiny thin membrane straws with very low pressure inside the oxygen basically gets sucked out of the water flowing into the area of lower oxygen but of course they can't take out too much or the animals will asphyxiate it has to be perfectly balanced every hour of every day I cannot go to the deep sea and I probably shouldn't I should leave that to the researchers who are dedicated to understanding and protecting it but the people at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and places like them have worked extremely hard to bring those environments those other worlds within our own to as many of us as they can to inspire wonder and joy and awe at the marvels of our planet and the Curiosity and Ingenuity of the people who inhabit it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John thanks for joining me in our brand new format which I'm sure we will bring back again but today instead of that I'm back in the old space and I'm going to do an old format this one is the one where you ask Google what questions people have been asking by starting to ask it a question and not finish good old Google autocomplete why is there an egg shortage well broadly it is because we build many systems for efficiency rather than resilience if you want to make a lot of eggs really cheap you got to have one very big room with a whole lot of chickens in it but that's also a fantastic circumstance for the transmission of disease like bird flu in order to control diseases Farmers have to kill all of the birds in a facility when one bird gets bird flu and then disinfect the whole place over 60 million birds have been killed in the current bird flu outbreak and that decreases the number of eggs on the market while demand stays roughly the same five dollars for a dozen eggs is a lot of money compared to what we were spending this time last year but a dollar 33 for a dozen eggs which is what we were spending this time last year is a price that some would argue should be a little bit bit higher to allow for more resiliency in that system why is the sky blue the white light that comes from the sun is made of a bunch of different wavelengths that all look different colors to us the gases in our atmosphere are good at scattering blue wavelengths out of the white light so the sun with the blue ticking out looks a little bit yellow while the sky with a blue scattering around looks like blue but as I have said before the sky doesn't exist It's Just an Illusion a kind of one colored rainbow why is my poop green could be a lot of different things uh probably something you ate either it's a bunch of green vegetable stuff or green food coloring or maybe some antibiotics or different medications will turn your poop green if it's accompanied by diarrhea or other symptoms that have been going on for multiple days go see a doctor I'm not a doctor and neither is the internet why is my eye twitching I don't know same though maybe it's because of the this we don't actually know why I was twitched though it's definitely correlated with fatigue and stress and if you don't have one or the other or both of those well done I'm just I'm loving that for you I'm not I'm fine why is the flag at half mass in the U.S and probably other places definitely Canada now that I found this clip when mourning something we often put the flag only halfway up this is sometimes because of like big National tragedies that are in the news but it's also often because of the death of a member of the government or some public servant and it varies from state to state flag Express which sells flags keeps track of this on their website so you can always know if you want to why is my poop black this is significantly more concerning and less common than green poop you should probably go see a doctor immediately it could be because you're bleeding somewhere in your GI tract why is it called Black Friday well At the moment I'm thinking it has something to do with poop but I know that that can't be right so I'll look it up I guess I looked it up and I'm gonna be honest with you it's boring it's like oh there's a lot of traffic on the day after Thanksgiving on the roads people didn't like that why is JJ Watt retiring I don't know man that sounds like a pretty personal question why is these diesel so expensive well it's taxed a little bit higher so that makes it a little bit more expensive also recently we started to require in the US low sulfur diesel because of the human health consequences of having all that sulfur in the air the biggest reason is that when you have a barrel of crude oil the part that can get turned into gasoline is fairly big and it's more flexible that part can be used for a bunch of different stuff that's like high value and low value and you can sort of mix up the market based on what's most needed and most expensive well the part that can get turned into diesel is smaller and the stuff it can get turned into is more valuable than diesel like jet fuel so there's just more higher value demand for the diesel fraction of the crude which drives up the price and our final question in the Google autocomplete list why is my dog shaking and gosh I don't know that that sounds scary I'm sorry about your dog it could be stress anxiety nervousness cold excitement but if this is a new thing and you're worried about it again I'm not a doctor of animals or people so maybe you should go see the vet John after 16 years I still love making videos with you why is this so much fun I don't know but I like it and I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John this is a weird way to make a video I recently fell down while ice skating I didn't fall down actually I dove in front of Oren to make him laugh because I will do anything to see that little kid smile ankle on my hip stayed like in the same place just sort of like right in line with each other but unfortunately my need not occupy any space inside of that line um so that hurts and now I'm squatting this is probably an observation people have made about Los Angeles before but but it's very weird that they're a lot a lot of advertisement tens of millions of dollars of advertisements that are asking me to consider a film or television show for awards Sarah 9921 members of The Academy so each one of those ads is for an audience of less than ten thousand the thing is it must work like they wouldn't do it if it didn't work but how many people that kind of sway so it was really it's not even about the 9921 it's about the like 45 people who might change their votes based on seeing this thing if you could just find those 45 people and give them each a million dollars it would be the same thing all because there's that much economic value I'm now I'm doing stand-up comedy except I'm not I'm just doing stand-up like upset it's a lot of stand-up comedy these days was really just stand up upset I'm gonna do squat down upsettity that's give me loving like I could make a really bad joke uh and everybody'd be like ah but on artificial intelligence makes a really bad joke and everybody loses their minds but this makes sense because if I ask you what like 522 times 8 divided by 64 is no like you don't know if the computer does that not a big deal but if you do that in front of me everybody would lose their minds like I would be like oh like when computers could first do those math problems was it like that were people that freaked out like the way that we were like write a poem about Gilligan's Island in the style of 50 Cent and it didn't like the I would do it like oh wow people felt when calculators were first already I can see this happening where we're like well yeah I mean of course AI can tell you how to hot wire a car as a Shakespearean sonnet but only if you give it like an ethical dilemma as a reason to tell you why to hotwire a car that's no big deal that's what AI does it's been a month we adapt so fast like we're gonna make a living computer sometime in my life it seems like and that's gonna be like amazing huge news on Friday they'll be like we found alien life in a computer we accidentally did that and then on Wednesday it won't even be like new gossip it'll be the same gossip but 40 years from now would be just like Harry Styles and Taylor Swift doing something and I love it and then a year later it'd be like yes this is my friend Steve he's a computer man he's a man-made of computer and he's my friend and that's not weird we this is what we do I found a sticker let me read you what it says it says Samantha Rose Garrison vampire boy available on all streaming platforms [Music] killing our favorite toys little did you know I haven't been before little did you know I could give you a toy of all the best places [Music] good morning John I know that we said maybe we weren't going to do videos this week but hey I found something that I really wanted to share with you and it is this lid to a tea it's a tea lid from a Boba place and it's specifically a tea lid that you can use for Boba so I guess you can do hot Boba and you would put the Boba straw through this part of the teal and then you got your normal sipping hole here this is the hy90m5 if you want to look it up and there's something very odd about this tea lid and I want to know what's going on and I can't figure out the answer and so I'm turning to the power that I have and should not abuse in this way but please someone to help me figure out what's going on if you take a look at the hy90 M5 can we get a focus you will see that it says heat 110 degrees Celsius that to me is very weird on its own but then also notice that the one and the one are different fonts I'm gonna talk through why I think this is so strange for the hy90m5 to say heat one one zero degrees Celsius and have the ones be in two different fonts first of all tea is made out of liquid water and liquid water cannot get hotter than 100 degrees Celsius so you cannot heat tea hotter than 100 degrees Celsius unless you're changing the pressure unless you are putting it in a pressure vessel and putting a bunch of extra air molecules in there you cannot heat to above 100 degrees Celsius you especially cannot do that in Montana where we're way above sea level but that's not part of the conversation the only thing that makes sense that it means to me is that this beverage is hot like you wanted to re-emphasize the part where it says caution hot across the top you wanted to reemphasize that with the heat of the drink in here is 110 degrees Celsius which to an American does not sound very hot so that's a problem but I understand this lid is not necessarily made for an American audience because it's a bobolin and we haven't been on the Boba train for that long and we certainly haven't been on the hot Boba train for very long I have of course looked this up it's a lid from Taiwan where they use celsius so the only thing that makes sense is that they put heat 110 degrees Celsius just to re-emphasize that this is very hot it's hotter than you think it is it's hotter than boiling water even though that is literally impossible unless it contains pure steam so I want to tell you the incorrect thing that I thought about this I thought that it said heat 110 degrees Celsius because originally it said heat 100 degrees Celsius and then somebody decided to take off one of the zeros and add a one just to totally emphasize that this is hotter than boiling water even though that's not possible then it can't it isn't it isn't but they wanted people to be safe so they added an extra 10 degrees Celsius to an already impossible temperature and when they did that they used a different phone they didn't have access to the original document they had to cut and paste to make it look like it said 110 degrees Celsius in fact if you look very close the bottom of this one is a little bit higher than the bottom of this one so it's definitely Photoshop and the only reason to do that is if you want to make get more clear that this is very hot liquid but I wanted to confirm this so I went on the internet and I looked up the hy90 M5 and John it used to say 120 degrees Celsius it used to say 120 degrees Celsius and they changed it to a lower temperature I assume because some patent like me was like there isn't a way that the t is 120 degrees Celsius it would just be steam it would be gaseous water it would explode and so they lowered it to an also impossible temperature like somebody did that making sure that extra work was done so that no one would be happy if anybody has any theories about how this happened that more accurately explains the given circumstances in ways that are less infuriating please let me know John I hope you're having a wonderful New Year's and I'll see you in 2023 good morning John it is likely my last video of 2015. 2020 to 2022. Juicy crust pins get down it's gonna be 2023 John I'm very grateful to you for sharing some thoughts about my books I remember when the second one was coming out I was like talking to Media about it and stuff and people were like what's this about and I'm terrible at that so I said like the first book I kind of wrote to try and like share more clearly what the internet is actually like and this book though the second one is more like what I think it's gonna be like and it is legitimately weird to watch as various parallels hit I just think that fiction writing and reading is a really good place to find Insight because when I think about like Elon and Twitter it's very hard not to get caught up in a lot of the details and a lot of like my biggest concerns about Society what I'm thinking about Peter and Altus it's like oh yeah yeah I get that I know all about that it's very easy to manufacture whatever reasoning you need to do the thing and get the thing that you are hungry for and there's not that many things that people get hungry for it's like food is one of them water air Joy sex meaning love it's a pretty short list so it makes perfect sense for there to be a character who will do literally the opposite of what he has spent his whole public life championing in order to get status because it brings him meaning and he desperately wants that we are very bad like research shows this we are very bad at arguing with ourselves we almost always end up believing what we want to believe and that's a super fun thing to say about other people but it's less comfortable to say about ourselves but it is true of all of us and it's a good thing to look at as we head into a new year with things changing very fast one thing I've learned about me is that I'm very good at becoming whatever an internet platform wants me to be I just had a two go viral on Mastodon I had the top two to the day on Mastodon I got good at YouTube and then Twitter and then Tick Tock and I like spending time in those places they bring me joy they bring me connection they bring me meaning they bring me attention so it's so hard to trust my instincts about whether it's good to spend time I'm in those places and what to do while I'm there because I'm arguing with myself and myself wants to do it so I don't know like should I do what we did for like the first 10 years of this and just like Vibe with what I think is interesting and fly toward the light like a mom or should I be constantly second guessing myself and wondering whether my like pro-social biology is being hacked by algorithms for anti-social aims that are resulting in epidemics of misinformation and disconnection and loneliness I guess John I need to do both which is annoying because it's work it's not just like job work either it's like personal work it's work I have to do on myself to understand my motivations gotta understand my responsibilities that's a no I don't want to I don't want to do that it sucks a little bit to feel conflicted about the things that bring you Joy and how do we make progress unless we talk about problems right like there isn't a way but I do honestly think that there is Damage Done by never being able to see anything without also simultaneously critique like there is critique there there's space for it but you can also love it all of the people I love there is they have space for critique including myself everything has room for improvement but nobody thinks that like room for improvement is synonymous with evil all right what I think I'm trying to get at is that I need to use the internet and internet Platforms in ways where I think I'm more engaging with problems than creating problems more focused on doing work than on deepening conflict but I need to err on the side of being really quite sure if it feels like it might be a little bit good might be a little bit bad I'm arguing with myself and myself as the person who's about to get a lot of attention and notoriety and Status by Tweeting or saying the thing that I'm not sure if it's good or bad are you are you not sure or do you just not want to look too hard at it yeah I thought so John I will see you in 2023 good morning John in 2010 YouTube celebrated itself with a thing called YouTube Rewind at that point this was just a top 10 list of the most popular YouTube videos of the Year something that you could do back in 2010 when a viral video was something that happened maybe once a week and not a hundred times per day like it does now but YouTube Rewind really became itself in 2012 with a video that brought lots of top YouTubers into physical Studios together to be a part of the memes I remember feeling quite left out that I was not a YouTube Rewind that year or the next year so we did manage to slip into what may have been the peak of the series rewind 2014 which is a Vibe even re-watching that though it's clear that there is a problem already a YouTube video was moving away from being a genre of content and toward being a kind of content to illustrate what I mean by that and the shift that really happened between 2016 and 2018 allow me to propose to you a thought experiment Spotify rewind a single video that attempts to encapsulate the entire music Industries year in six minutes no one wants this because it does not make any sense now starting in 2016 Spotify started to do something that people actually liked then and continue to like now rapt is a recap of what you liked not like what happened in music that year what you enjoyed in music and podcasts now on YouTube in 2016 things were simple enough that people were like yeah okay a fair number of these folks are people I have some affinity for or at least familiar with but by 2018 the story of YouTube was very big very complex and had been really quite full of Scandal and more than anything a YouTube video was not a genre of content anymore it was a kind of content it was not a single Community anymore it was many communities and many of those communities disliked each other they had to have known that people would not like it but in the way of large companies I'm sure a lot of people looked at it and they said this is bad but it's the thing that we do and we've done it so let's do it now in response to it being the most disliked YouTube video ever in 2019 they just did like another top 10 video except with more production value and people also disliked that it was clear to me at that point that there would never be a YouTube Rewind and there was not another YouTube Rewind I would like to propose that we bring it back now people are annoyed by Spotify wrapped they will say Spotify rap sucks either because they don't use Spotify and annoys them to feel left out or because they think that like your taste in music doesn't make you an interesting person but I am neither of those kinds of person and I actually think that Spotify raps delivers a ton of value to the people who make content the people who use the platform and the platform itself it seems to be a huge win it shows me who I love which I actually don't know I don't know what YouTuber I watch the most of it gives people content to share if they would like to that's great promotion for Spotify and for the musicians and podcasters who are featured and I think that it gives especially smaller podcasters and musicians a chance to feel appreciated and to connect with their audience I think that this is what YouTube Rewind should be and I think that they should just call it YouTube Rewind I think that that's great a breakdown of my year on YouTube who did I watch who did I like is there a Creator who basically like I'm a bigger fan of them than anyone else because I bet I am I bet I'm gonna like 0.1 percent of a few creators any comments have you left how many videos have you liked how many super thanks and super chats have you sent and in a perfect world there's a chance for me to type a message to my favorite Creator and then the day after YouTube Rewind happens creators get their own rewind that gives them all their stats and a few messages from people who appreciate their content I think Spotify wrapped does good things for the audience the creators and the platforms and I think for the people who find it annoying they're part of the discourse too it's a fun day and it fixes all of YouTube rewinds original problems that it had to pick winners that it had to try and portray YouTube in a particular way that was maybe not consistent with how we were imagining it and of course with YouTube no longer being anything like a unified culture and so YouTube if you're listening put me in coach my Consulting rates are high they consist entirely of donations to Partners in Health John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John I want to tell you about one of the coolest things I've ever found out in my life it really threw me for a loop and I want to throw you for the same Loop so join me on the journey when studying life on our planet it is sometimes useful to think about like how much the living matter of the planet weighs on its own I'm this is enough of this code on its own the idea of living matter is pretty freaking weird right living matter but that's what we are and that matter has mass like I have about 90 000 grams of living matter or do I like not really most of it's water like life couldn't exist without it but it isn't really part of the living system it's kind of just like an ocean that I'm carrying around in a sack with me everywhere I go so that I can do the chemistry that is life what the scientific establishment has decided to do is just count the carbon which makes sense I think that's a good way to do it of course it's not perfectly precise but it's precise enough we call this biomass for example if you look at the biomass of all mammals around a third of it human beings if that seems weird to you it's going to be way weirder than that that's like the least weird thing in the video another third is cows just cows now you might be thinking that leaves the final third for wild mammals I'm sorry no uh further 30 is the rest of the Agricultural animals and four percent four percent of mammal biomass is wild mammals all of the whales and elephants and skunks and armadillos and shrews now is that the weirdest thing in the video no it's not I used to think when I heard this stat that this meant that there used to be a hundred percent wild mammals and now like 96 of them have been replaced by agricultural animals and humans that's not what happened around a hundred thousand years ago humans had a very tentative foothold on the planet pretty insignificant species in terms of biomass and at that point wild mammal biomass was at its peak but had been roughly the same for a very long time it wasn't increasing it wasn't decreasing it was quite stable between 100 000 years ago and ten thousand years ago human biomass changed some but was still pretty insignificant to ten thousand years but wild mammal biomass dropped by like 25 a very big very fast drop we call this the quaternary megafauna Extinction it was an Extinction event of almost entirely very large mammals lots of debate about this definitely a contributor to it uh was human it's very tightly coincided with the arrival of humans in North and South America and then separately in Australia what happens next is the very weird part between 10 000 years ago and 100 years ago agriculture happens like in a big way while the mammal biomass Falls by a further third but the total mammal biomass increases beyond what it ever was purely because of humans and livestock and now in the year 2022 humans by themselves represent three times more biomass than all mammals combined before humans we are heavy in the last hundred thousand years there has been an 85 percent decrease in the wild mammal biomass and an 800 percent increase in the total mammal biomass throughout this video I've been trying to not have any particular judgment about whether the world should be the way that it is just that it's fascinating that it is the way that it is but entering into our conclusion here uh it's bad like it's bad to have an 85 decrease in Wild mammal biomass but it's also very complex like the Earth is absolutely hundred percent at its historical maximum of complicated brains I don't know if y'all caught this but a few days ago some baby was born that was the eight billionth person on the planet I hope they at least got a certificate so I don't really know what to say about this except that obviously we need to be doing all of this quite thoughtfully because this is a very big and fast change and I think that you can make the case that we are actually doing it more thoughtfully now than we were a hundred years ago it's also really great to be able to get coffee and socks delivered to your door once a month and to know that there are people working hard to try and do that as thoughtfully as possible coffee plantations can for example lead to a lot of deforestation but it can also be done in partnership with a forest the small farmers who work with the awesome coffee Club work hard to decrease deforestation and to practice regenerative agriculture the stock club's closing Monday there will not be another VLAN Brothers video between now and then so if you want to sign up you got to do it now the coffee Club will remain open perpetually John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John it's Thursday what am I doing here this is now one of my days I'm making two videos this week because I want to explain something you may have noticed you probably didn't but you might have they were planning on having the awesome socks Club window open for two weeks and now we are into our third week what is that about well we thought that when we launched you would have the ability to switch over from crew socks which are like up to the calf and to ankle socks which starting in January so you could switch over and in January get your first pair of ankle socks and because technology is hard that wasn't the case it's so hard just that one feature has been quite a difficulty it makes me feel like I would never pay a lot of money to acquire a technology company but if we closed it down it would become very hard to switch people over to the ankle socks so we kept it open and now that feature is live and you can go to awesomesocs.club and there's a link and there's also a link down in the description that you can go to if you'd like to switch to ankle socks starting in January you can't do it before then because we won't have ankle socks until January but now that that feature is live it does mean that the stock subscription window will close on Monday the 21st so this is really easier last week for real this time just because there's been a bunch of people who wanted to switch over and haven't been able to I wanted to make a video just like get that message out as far as it could possibly get also really excited about the light roast for the coffee club that launched this week we don't have decaf yet I'm a decaf Drinker we're gonna get there turns out decaf is surprisingly complicated and we want to do it right that's like the whole thing here the idea is that like we're working hard to make sure that the the things we make are like really high quality you get to wear some art on your feet or you get to have like the best coffee that just tastes really good and is good for the world and if we can't do decaf right we're not going to do decaf until we can and when we do I will tell you all all about how decaf is made which is fascinating and why it's so complicated to do it well anyway just want to tell you about the sock thing John you'll see me tomorrow good morning John a few months ago I made a video arguing that Elon Musk misunderstood the challenges of content moderation in social media and that I figured he was quickly discovering as nilai Patel has said that the main product of a social media platform is content moderation whether that's recommendations or algorithmic feeds or demoting and censoring hateful content I think that I was right about that but also that Elon was right about something else that I totally missed and should have seen I am a person who professionally understands a large group of people that's not the whole job but it's a big piece of it like understanding what people will like what they are thinking about what they're concerned about what they're worried about what they're excited about Elon Musk is absolutely right that his people his audience are really worried about something that they call Free Speech this is not what I call free speech and it is not what is protected by the First Amendment but it is a thing and it's a totally legitimate thing here it is internet media platforms have a huge influence on society and there are people who work at those platforms who we do not know know and thus cannot trust who have a huge influence on what is allowed on those platforms and what is promoted and demoted that's real and it's weird and it's worrying because this is a lot of how people communicate now now what Elon Musk said out loud about this was if people want laws preventing speech they'll pass laws preventing speech and until that happens Twitter should just allow all legal speech that's what he said but what he meant was somebody's going to be making these subjective moderation decisions and I don't trust them but I do trust myself and a lot of other people trust me too as I tweeted a few weeks ago a lot of people who say they want free speech actually just want to be the one in charge of which speech is free I thought elon's audience was going to get super mad at him very quickly because it would turn out that he would have to continue making all these subjective content moderation decisions because Twitter still had to be a business that was appealing to users and advertisers I was totally wrong about this Elon Musk doesn't need to change the content moderation policies of Twitter in order to satisfy his audience because this isn't about policy it's about Vibes it's not about the decisions it's about who is making the decisions indeed so far he hasn't changed any policies though I'm not going to put it past it even the ones that he was most upset about before he was in charge and it seems mostly like his audience isn't at all concerned about that so elon's obviously feeling very empowered so is his audience but now we have the opposite problem his people are happy everybody else is either unhappy or at least concerned because remember I just said this it was never about the decisions it was about The Vibes it was about who's making the decisions and a lot of people are not and will never be fans of Elon Musk Twitter's previous management for all of its failures did try to like listen to people who were upset and then make a decision that was thoughtful and transparent but Elon is mostly just gleefully antagonistic towards people who don't agree with that and if those people who've Twitter it just becomes an eight dollar a month subscription to the Elon Musk fan club and that's not a good website however right now the opposite is happening people are flocking to Twitter specifically because of Elon musk's erratic Behavior is the second thing he was right about that I didn't get people don't want Twitter to be stable they want it to be reality TV drama constantly unfolding before them feeling important despite being mostly inconsequential leaning into the interesting has been good for Twitter's growth but I think it's been very bad for Twitter internally and I think it's been bad for advertising dollars and I have no idea whether you can build a sustainable business this way it seems like it would be hard uh and there are a number of challenges that Twitter will need to overcome but what I do know is that while Twitter only occasionally brings me joy the awesome socks Club brings me joy every single month you can get a different pair of socks designed by a different independent artist to deliver to your door once a month free shipping cancel anytime ankle socks or mid-calf Crews now we're shipping out of the EU so you don't have to worry about Customs if you're in Europe I just want to make this as easy a decision as possible the socks are super comfy people will tell you this they're all I wear anymore and 100 of the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John I recently realized that I have an obsession I didn't know about which is not that unusual for me I was just scrolling through my photos like you do and I noticed that in the last few weeks I've taken a lot of pictures of signs so then I just searched Google photos for signs and I found out that I have taken like hundreds of pictures of signs over the last 15 years the earliest one was actually from 2004 so we're we're getting up close to 20. and a lot of them are just objectively very good so I'm going to share with you now my favorites one thing I love about a sign is if it's telling me more than it thinks it's telling me for example this Swan Hunters must have visible means of retrieval sign told me that there are Swan hunters in the world and that sometimes they shoot a swan that they cannot retrieve and that that is a problem that can only really be avoided in one way this sign told me that pit toilets are cleaned by human beings which is something I probably should have known but didn't it also just has a tremendous Kick-Ass aesthetic with all of the scratch graffiti this sign told me that somebody kicked the pony I also really like secret signs like this one I found on the inside door of a mailbox I also like signs that tell me there's a story without telling me what the story is like these three signs that all say do not enter but one of them has been taped over like why why tape over one there is a story here I cannot imagine what it is I love a beautiful sign but I also love a sign that becomes more beautiful like this Railway marker the way that the coding on the sign fractal differently given the different shape of the W and the five same with these two danger signs so great and this rusted up Beast was at that same power station which was behind the lab I worked at in 2004. these were the oldest photos I have of signs possibly this was the beginning of my obsession oh so long ago aging signs is something I really seem to be into I looked at this one for a really long time but I could never figure out what the danger was and then there's the sign marker at the end of a trail in the National Bison Range that I have taken pictures of so many times that I have a catalog of its deterioration I love signs that try to be very clear and succeed like this danger sign I saw in Italy but I also love signs that try too hard to be very clear like this no e-bike sign that has one two three four different indicate caters that it's talking specifically about e-bikes very clearly every person in the meeting had a different idea for how to represent e-bikes and they decided to use all of them but most of all my favorite genre of sign it's clear and looking through them is signs that are accidentally funny but before we get to that I gotta remind you that you are going to need to buy socks throughout your life but instead of that being a chore I want to take care of it for you the awesome socks Club will send you a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist every month we've worked hard to make them cozy and durable and delightful shipping is free you can cancel anytime and all the profit goes to decrease maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone you can sign up for ankle socks or mid-calf cruise and you can get five dollars off your first month with a link in the description you can pause the video right now I will still be here when you get back so what do I mean by unintentionally funny designs well there is a Hall of Fame example here in Missoula Montana this sign which is meant to be two signs but it is impossible to not read it as one certain misspelled signs can be very funny for example this yard sale sign was a huge win for me once I really hit the jackpot when they were reorganizing my grocery store got snack time Eye Care and feminine care breakfast juices and Candy as well as baby care bleach dish soap this one I can't really tell if it was meant to be funny it seemed entirely sincere so I'm including it then there's this giant bronze banana in Palm Springs one of the hottest places in America and it's hot it's a hot banana it's a hot banana it's on the edge of whether this is a sign but these labeled poster boxes from the dftba warehouse which can either be red top to bottom or bottom to top giving very different perspectives on the human story and then I'm gonna end with one of my faves is it my favorite I don't know maybe maybe it is but please don't flash the octopus it's it's in it's at least in the top tier John you can only sign up for the awesome Sox Club this week and next week so you might as well go do it now I'll see you on Tuesday oh look and as a special present this is wild I had 15 extra seconds in this video even though the script was very long so I I don't know what I did I guess I talked really fast but here's some others of my favorites okay five dollars off the awesome socks club with the link in the description good morning John so a couple of months ago I posted a video of me making headquarter fish art for project for awesome donors and there were a bunch of people helping me right here this person is Monica tranelle the reason she's there is that she's running for congress and I wanted to maybe talk to her if I could and so I emailed her and she said let's have coffee and I said let's let's make fish so that was the first time I met Monica trannell but over the last few months I've met her a few more times mostly because I said I would like to rent out some rooms and interview you in them publicly time for some honesty I don't know how to be a person with a big audience who also doesn't like the way that the world is obviously different people have different views on the way that the world should be but I have mine I don't like a lot of the way things are we've had an audience of some kind for a long time I remember celebrating the election of Barack Obama with you like the first one while we were on tour I think we've been doing this for a while but most of what we've done over the years has been pretty nationally focused which makes a lot of sense because our audience is isn't even National it's International so focusing local like very few people here are going to have the opportunity to vote for Monica trannell some of you though and you better because she's great but in general I've started to feel like the Relentless focus on the biggest possible scope of all conversations that always being National isn't good I live in Montana a state that Trump won by 16 in 2020 and by 20 in 2016 but in 2016 we also elected a Democratic governor and we have a Democratic senator John tester who is amazing I don't think anybody would expect that I think most people don't know that because it doesn't fit into the national narrative we are a very red state that does a lot of pretty blue things we can only really tell ourselves simple stories when we don't let a lot of data in now I understand not letting a lot of data and it's very complicated and we want to tell simple stories so that people will believe the thing but these simple stories are starting to Rend Rend so when Joe Biden's team emailed me and they were like do you want to come to the White House to hang out with the president I was like yeah I do but I really only have so much time this year and I'm focusing a lot on what's going on in my community I want to think about that I want to be aware of that I want to know how amazing Monica trannell is and she is amazing and if she doesn't win it's going to be because of a focus on National politics like her opponent isn't very popular but Democrats are unpopular she's put like fifty thousand miles on her minivan traveling across what is one of the largest districts in America talking to people in 16 counties and two tribal Nations and she keeps telling me every chance she gets that she just wishes that I and everybody else could see the America that she sees when she goes out there to listen to people what those conversations are telling her is that people are a lot more complex than they get credit for and that seems wrong to me but her perspective is actually backed up by the research which shows that people see themselves as being pretty 60 40 on stuff but they see their opponents as being very 100 zero on everything in fact there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fit into broader narratives and because it doesn't we just don't ever think about it or talk about it that true fact feels unintuitive to me but it feels intuitive to Monica because she's the one out there doing the work that is why we hire other people to be our leaders because they get to know more about this than we ever will so that we can focus on doing the other thing the problems are very big but this country is messy and it is Led in a lot of different ways and the ballot that I get is a local ballot with local things on it so this election with the time that I had I decided to go local and I feel really good about it John I'll see you on Tuesday and if you can vote in this election you're going to go local too if you aren't sure how to vote where you are or whether you're registered Etc you can check out youtube.com how to vote in every state and I will tell you everything you need to know good morning John one thing we do not talk a lot about here on vlogbrothers is math but I'm about to show you a very low stakes math problem that you don't have to get right that did change the way that I see the social internet when the last vestiges of my timetable still holding on I initially realized that each of the numbers on the right was a multiple of the ones on the left from there I realized that there was a pattern 9 times 10 is 90 8 times 9 is 72 7 times 8 is 56 6 times 7 is 42. great so what is three this math question went viral on Twitter because people were arguing about what three is you may have even been Snappy enough to form an opinion yourself a lot of people said it was 12. a lot of people said it was 18. the 12 people and the 18 people were arguing with each other and they were all very certain that they were right team 18 pointed out that there was a sequence of numbers being multiplied ten nine eight seven and then the next number six would be six times three which would be eighteen twelve said that every number is being multiplied by itself plus one nine times ten six times seven and so three times four is twelve watching people on Twitter argue about this was a little like having sand thrown into my eyes because of course there are two correct answers to this question and neither of them is 12 or 18. the two correct answers are either 12 or 18 not 12 or 18 but 12 or 18. or the second correct answer is the question is wrong but here's the thing to me the right answer is 12. because n times n plus 1 just seems more mathy to me than a sequence being multiplied by the numbers but that's not right in this situation everyone who believes their answer is right is wrong the only people who are right are the ones who know they don't know now with math problems when they are unclear you know that it's a poorly created math problem but with almost every other kind of problem you know that if it is unclear that's actually a pretty good sign that it's a real problem like if it's clear how to solve it it's probably not that big of a problem but I learned something else very interesting from this confounding incorrect math problem which I started to learn when I noticed that people were talking about this rather than every other math problem there's nothing interesting about a math problem everyone agrees on one of the very few reasons that math goes viral is when people fight like this mess of an equation that I see all the time it might seem to a person like me that this would be an important math problem because it comes up a lot but mathematicians don't think this problem is interesting they wouldn't try to answer that question they would ask for it to be Rewritten and so if vague questions that are easy to argue about mislead us into Imagining the world incorrectly I it's important to ask why these questions are easy to argue about and here's why it's not just that people believe different things in this situation it's that it is easy to believe different things looking at this problem it is as easy to know that the answer is 12 as it is to know that the answer is 18. a question like that is bound to get some attention whether it is about math or guns or immigration particularly it will get a lot of questions from people who don't know that much about it because experts are aware that the problem is poorly phrased and badly done and so aren't really interfacing with it but for the rest of us these are situations where it's very easy to have one of several different opinions that are not the same answer questions like that due to the nature of humanity and its algorithms are gonna be the ones we're most likely to see and that's going to drive wedges and not just in the way that we usually think where it's like between two big political parties but also within political parties within communities within people who broadly agree with each other on almost everything they just don't notice because those aren't the interesting things when if the question was asked in a more complete way we wouldn't find it interesting because we'd all agree vague questions that lead to the formation of simple opinions that are likely to conflict with the opinions of others are much more likely to create conflict and thus much more likely to go viral and also very often the answers to those questions are invalid because the questions themselves are wrong John I will see you on Tuesday good morning John the other day I was on Twitter and I noticed a hashtag in the trending tab that I thought was appealing it was appealing to me it said nerd farters and I was like that's very funny I wonder I wonder what that is and honestly I was astounded to find that it was the hashtag of an October nerdfighter art prompt challenge that I did not know existed I found out about it through the trending tab on Twitter which I famously disliked but I suppose the product does deliver some useful information maybe not some maybe just one one piece of useful information which was the existence of the nerdfarters October nerdfighter art prompt challenge so the story is dftba Rachel had the idea ask people if they would be interested and then sweet Carolyn came along and said what if you called it nerd farters people were into it Rachel created this spooky graphic that had a different prompt for each of the 31 days in October we're almost halfway through the month and I wanted to share with you some of the genius that has been created and I hope that more will continue coming the first prompt was simply dftba which people went in a lot of different directions with and since it's the first one I'll go ahead and show you all of them that were submitted I won't do that for any of the other ones the great thing about this is no one is really trying to be a virtuoso except for Alice what the heck Alice now I'm not going to tell you any of my favorites of these but my favorite is obviously the one where I get chased by the crab with a knife our next prompt Pizza John yourself which is unexceptionally good prompt then we had Breezy fall day which is a reference to my second novel thank you for that followed by just the word Pelican on October 4th which is as delightful as you would expect next we have surprise fiddle concert which you could do anything with and then nerdfighteria and then pizzimus and then possibly my favorite prompt of the whole month draw a crab you have to do a bad job it is one thing to be told that you can do a bad job but I think that we need to require ourselves to do a bad job more often otherwise it's just too much pressure and you will never do the thing because you think you're bad at the thing but you can't get better at the thing if you don't do the thing going deeper into the lore here now we have French the llama and puppy-sized elephant then we got million dollar idea featuring surprisingly edible and the awesome club club which look I'm not saying we're gonna do that but I'm not saying that we aren't going to do it either then this Wednesday we had pumpkins and Penguins unsurprisingly full of delightful stuff including an actual pumpkin because it is indeed Halloween and then yesterday The Prompt was hope is the thing with feathers but I filmed this so early yesterday that there weren't any posted yet so if you want to see them you have to go look for the Nerdfighters hashtag on Twitter or follow nerdfarters on Twitter there were of course way too many nerd farts for me to post all of them in this video and it only seems to have been growing organically as the month has gone on and I very much hope that this video will inspire more people to go check it out maybe submit a couple prompts to yourself maybe you have to do a bad job I really love all the prompts I'm personally most looking forward to robot Carl that's exciting for me Superior fish beings is going to be amazing and also of course just I'm very excited to see your lemon man after all these years of doing this and all of the other things that we do I am very happy and excited to not be in control of many of the cool things that happen in this community I think and call me crazy that doing things is never about doing the best thing I think that it is about doing things and ideally doing things with people that you like a lot and who are cool and I am really feeling that energy right now having discovered this organically which is the strangest part like I'd seen a couple of Arts but I hadn't I hadn't like put it together that it was part of a thing until the hashtag just popped up which I guess is why they do the hashtag I just wish it wasn't constantly full of things that make me angry and sad but sometimes it's full of the thing that makes me happy and and what's the opposite of angry I don't know what's the opposite of angry I haven't figured it out let me know if you know what the opposite of angry is John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John in 2014 my social media was suddenly inundated with people telling me about and telling me to talk about solar freaking roadways an Indiegogo campaign that had been published by a company that was making roads that could good news solve every problem because look America is extremely paved there are so many roads and so many parking lots and so many more parking lots than you think there are if we were placed all of the paved area in the U.S with solar panels we would produce more power than the US uses which is a wild statistic that is completely irrelevant the list of reasons why solar roads are a bad idea is very long I will put an incomplete list on the screen right now I'll also put some links in the description but this video is not about why silver roads are a bad idea it's about why so many people thought they were a good idea in medicine or on the podcast sawbones you often hear that cure-alls cured nothing the human body and all the things that can go wrong with it are just too complex for there to be some magical simple solution that solves everything and as I re-watched that 2014 solar freaking roadways video the feeling I get is that the list of problems being solved is just too long they could improve drainage enhance playgrounds alert drivers to upcoming moose fixed the economy eliminate the need for fossil fuel melt snow Dick's power transmission and make partying more fun this is a video built to make people excited about something and since the average person doesn't know very much about how roads work we have people for that it's pretty easy to make a list of problems and then propose a solution that would solve all of them as long as you don't look too hard or know too much what this relies on is people not understanding how complex something that seems simple is and that's fine we're not supposed to nor can we know about everything I think this actually outlines a really important tension in society between like not wanting or being able to have everyone understand the intricacies of how tires interact with different paved surfaces at different levels of moisture and temperatures and speeds and also being frustrated by problems that we see and we see not getting fixed and then of course experts are annoyed when you're like why don't you just fix this problem and you're like well you don't want to know how complicated it is you don't want to know how tires work experts don't want to explain to you why you can't make highways out of glass but the division of expertise is like the number one thing that makes societies work but that stops working when there is no trust and stories of big Simple Solutions once they aren't implemented either rely on you realizing that it's more complicated or thinking that there's some super powerful cabal that's preventing us from doing the simple things which is why a lot of the times conversation about big Simple Solutions interfaces with conspiracy theory solar roadways are a big simple solution and I'm sorry but big Simple Solutions are very rare because everything is very complicated like soap may have been the last big Simple Solution so they do happen but it's been a while but honestly the reason I think this was a moment in a sort of Coney 2012 but two years later kind of way was a good impulse it was hopefulness like that was a hopeful moment we felt like the internet maybe could put an end to a Ugandan warlord or maybe even create a future where roads melted ice warned you about moose and generated more electricity than the cars that ran on them used maybe the problems weren't being solved because there wasn't enough hope or human excitement this was a wild time on the internet we did not know what was possible if only we hadn't found out the solar roadways people are actually still at it they've done some small scale installations and the way I see it it is an incremental value add for a very specific situations which get this is fine it's how almost everything gets done in this big messy complicated world because the big problems aren't there because evil people create them they are there because 8 billion people living together on a single planet is difficult and those big problems only ever really get solved in one situation and that's when lots of people with wildly varying areas of expertise trust each other and work together to solve them John I'll see you tomorrow good morning john so you know how covet 19 is a disease that is caused by sars cov2 which is a virus it feels like it would be better and simpler if we just called that the covid19 virus right so why don't we just do that well in the early 1900s doctors started noticing something weird about some different diseases they would sometimes have patients with shingles a really specific disease where you get a very painful rash on just one side of your body but then later those patients children would often come down with a totally different disease chickenpox which is like lots of different itchy bumps all over the body so they started to think that those two diseases might be caused by the same pathogen and they started to look for evidence of that after a lot of work in the 1950s it was finally confirmed separately in two different ways by two different scientists thomas huckleweller and evelyn nicole so this is one reason why we don't name viruses after the disease they cause indeed it looks like sarco v2 might kind of cause more than one disease there's covid19 and then there's like a blurry line between that and long coven if you want to know more about long covered we did an amazing scishow video about it i'll put a link in the doobly-doo the varicella zoster virus though which causes both shingles and chickenpox is a very clear-cut case children get chickenpox when they are infected by the varicella zoster virus and that happens either through droplets in the air or through exposure to the fluid from the rash or the bumps or more rarely they can get it from exposure to a person with the shingles rash which also contains the virus then almost all of the time quite quickly the child's immune system will fight off the disease and that virus will take refuge in your body for the rest of your life it finds a place to hide and that place is at the base of nerves near your spine and then as you get older your immune system might get weakened by stress or by medication or just by getting older and it will kind of forget about the herpes zoster virus and that will allow it to spring forth and infect the nerve at first that causes like tingling and then itching and then pain as the nerves get inflamed and this is why shingles almost always happens just on one side of the body in a specific area because it's the individual nerve that is having the infection the severity of the pain and discomfort from shingles which i can now personally attest to because i'm getting over a case right now feeling much better but it was very very bad it doesn't hurt anymore it just itches it's one of the reasons why we vaccinate almost all children against chickenpox in the u.s now this means far fewer kids are getting chickenpox and in the future they will be much less likely to get shingles as adults because you don't catch shingles shingles is in effect people might be mad at me for saying this like long chickenpox but other places that aren't the us are not vaccinating kids against chickenpox and the reason why is wild and may include my individual case of shingles in the u.s 95 of adults have had chickenpox which means that they could get shingles but only around one in three of them will but in 1995 we started to vaccinate pretty much every kid against chickenpox and cases of chickenpox among kids of course plummeted and that meant that younger people like me were less likely to be exposed to the virus from sick kids that exposure would be like a kind of natural vaccine that would work best for people in their 30s and 40s those people have fairly good immune systems they're also more likely to be around sick kids that would normally remind our immune systems to keep up the fight without those reminders the immune system is more likely to let the virus already in our bodies start to replicate and shingles slips through those cracks and that's especially the case when combined with immune suppressant medication and stress of which i have both so in effect i may have gotten shingles so that my son doesn't have to shingles rates kind of have to go up before they can go down rates of shingles and young people like me have indeed been on the rise though it doesn't seem to be affecting the rates of shingles in older people where it is more dangerous and that's also helped along by the fact that we now have a very effective shingles vaccine in addition to the separate chickenpox vaccine right now you can only get it if you're over 50 because it's in short supply but my guess is it will be available to younger people eventually this is just another example of how complicated disease and epidemiology and public health are it's just all complicated and hard to figure out and so i'm very grateful to all the people who are working to figure it out right now and to the people who have worked to figure it out in the past including evelyn nicole who was in her twenties when she first isolated the varicella zoster virus and who died of complications from covet 19 in 2020. john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so as you know i run a youtube company that makes educational videos and then gives them away it's not a super great business model but it does work most times the company continues to slowly grow making more things doing more stuff we have around 50 employees now you might find yourself asking how does that work and that's a great question i imagine complexly to be a project of nerdfighteria this is very much where complexly started and so if you are curious i would like to share how we make ends meet in this very new weird world first youtubers make 55 of the money that is made by the ads running on our content youtube also shares 55 of the money they make from youtube premium after their record labels take their cut which if you are curious turns out to be significantly more than an ad supported view but most people aren't signed up for premium so that's around three percent of complexity's revenue while youtube ads are around 28 number two grants a lot of people recognize that our content specifically crash course just generates a whole lot more value than it could ever capture like maybe millions of times more value and some of those people are wealthy or they work for wealthy people or institutions they want people to have access to great resources and so they give us money to make them now grants do sometimes have strings attached some are extra stringy but we always make it very clear that they can give us input and give us ideas but we are in charge of what gets created now this can fluctuate a ton from year to year but last year grants were responsible for about the same amount of revenue as youtube was at 29 coming in at just under 20 is crowdfunding so because people know that basically everything that we do is not sustainable given the current business models of internet content they give us money either through our patreons or through the crash course i think everybody supports things for different reasons but i think there's like a mix of like a selfish thing where like i want this content to exist so i will pay for it and more of a selfless thing which is that like i will pay for this so that all people can have access to it now crowdfunding does not come with any strings at all where advertising or grants could so not only does it make our stuff possible i think it makes it better because we get to make all the choices fourth at fourteen percent of our revenue we also sell our own ads so like policy genius on dear hank and john or curiosity stream on scishow that comes out of our internal sales team it's more of a pain in the butt but the ad rates are higher and we don't have to split it with anybody number five we also license our content to various platforms like it's all available for free but some people want our content like curiosity stream has a lot of crash course on it and we get paid for that altogether all of the licensing last year was about five percent of the company's revenue and last at two percent which is not nothing but it is two percent is physical product just bringing high quality things that provide value into people's lives like the micro cosmos microscope which i'm looking at but you can't see and we'd like to do more stuff like that which is why get this we are selling five calendars for five of our shows the eons and bizarre beasts calendars features the best of the original art created for those shows the micro cosmos calendar features the microphotography of james weiss our master of microscopes and the scishow and scishow space calendars just showcase the variety and beauty of our world and of worlds in our solar system every calendar is printed on high quality people in the us they ship everywhere and they feature not just beautiful images but also lots of interesting facts about those images because we cannot stop ourselves from sharing how cool the world is every show it complexly has a really different mix of how it makes itself sustainable some of our shows don't break even for a pretty long time some of them never do and we end up canceling them and it's hard and it's weird and it often feels like we don't know what we're doing but there's a reason for that which is that no one's done this before like companies like this didn't exist 10 years ago when complexity started we're just very busy trying things out seeing what works just using the talents and skills of people on the team to make things that are great and that we think people will like so how about this i come back next year and i tell you whether or not that two percent changed because maybe you needed a calendar and we made some great ones and they are available at complexitycalendars.com john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i just discovered that the way people used to ask the science side of tumblr questions people very very occasionally ask the science side of twitter questions so i just searched for science side of twitter and i'm going to answer as many questions as they can in four minutes are constellations different in the southern hemisphere like is the big dipper and the zodiac down there the constellations themselves don't change but you can see different ones depending on where you are on earth if you were on the north pole and the earth's axis weren't tilted then you could only ever see just the top half of the constellations and same for the south pole now it's a little complicated because it's tilting so your perspective actually changes a little bit throughout the year but if you're right on the equator as the year goes by you can actually see almost all of the sky though a lot of it will be really close to the horizon so hard to see if you find this confusing it's because it's very confusing the earth is revolving while it's rotating and we're also thinking about us being in different places on a rotating and revolving thing there are some people who get their heads all the way around this but they think about it for a living how do i stop look i don't know i have been told that you need an equal and opposite force i haven't found one yet but i have been assured that they exist what are these giant quasar looking stars though that's just a star that is in our galaxy all those background things in this image those are galaxies that are like billions of miles away so it's literally millions of times closer so it looks a lot brighter and super bright stuff when seen by the james webb space telescope has these diffraction spikes which is caused by the shape of the mirror how many calories on average do you burn taking a massive dump i mean not zero interestingly the anus is a muscle that is almost always contracting um and so it's always burning energy until it is loosened in that case it's burning less energy but i think that that's more than outweighed by a lot of other muscle contractions that are probably going on during the dump plus you know any anxiety you might be experiencing i might also burn a little extra calories why does ketchup have to be refrigerated isn't it primarily vinegar salt and sugar all of which are preservative fascinating question when we talk about preserving foods we're talking about two different things one is preventing bacteria from growing in it which is going to spoil it and make it dangerous high concentrations of vinegar salt and sugar will all prevent bacterial growth but we are also concerned about the complicated molecules in the food stuff breaking down into other molecules that might just taste less good once the ketchup is exposed to a good deal of oxygen those reactions are going to happen more quickly and so we want to slow them down and one way to do that is by having less heat in the system so putting it in the refrigerator hey science twitter any tips for reducing eye strain when using a microscope using a microscope is absolutely a lot of this which is like hunch and eye stream so i suggest you get one of these which the micro cosmos microscope comes with it's a cell phone holder you put the eyepiece in here and then you clamp your cell phone in here and you put it on and you're looking through your microscope like there's a screen now you do have to be able to choose which lens your cell phone is looking through which the iphone doesn't let you do by default there are apps that let you do that though the one i use is called procam and this one is specifically for me how did i get an actual brain freeze without consuming any liquids purely from pouring cold water over my face so a brain freeze is a kind of nerve pain it's your brain misinterpreting a confusing signal getting suddenly cold will cause all the blood vessels near your nerves to contract and then when they warm back up very quickly they will open back up and that will cause a flood of blood to the area that will just be confusing to the nervous system and in your face and head all these sensory nerves are really closely packed together so it's just more common for signals to get confused i think i haven't heard of this happening before but it totally seems like something that could happen does sound travel in outer space sound is just a bunch of molecules slapping into each other so you need a bunch of molecules really densely packed together to carry that signal in an atmosphere we have that this is actually pretty thick soup of molecules right here in space there are basically no molecules so they can't knock into each other to carry sound which is a good thing because the sun is so energetic that if space carried sound as well as our atmosphere it would be a constant 100 decibel roar that we would never not experience what's a good time to wake up my friends because my phone is dying and i need my charger block from their room what you're gonna want to do is get two potatoes and a copper wire and i'm kidding i've just looked at your tweet from 2 27 a.m you don't need to be on twitter anymore bedtime it's bedtime john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John hear me out what if people are almost all pretty good and they're just trying to make things better for themselves and the people they love in a world that has a whole lot of directional inertia what if we're all trying to do that in countries that have tens or hundreds of millions of people who all see the world a little differently from each other what if there are a bunch of leaders who have to try and figure out how to move forward while listening to the wants and needs and hopes and dreams and frustrations and fears of thousands or millions of people and what if this might be a stretch those people are mostly big bags of well-meaning worry trying to do the right thing when it's never clear what the right thing to do is something weird has happened to me in the last couple of weeks and it's the result of I think three different things first is that I finished this book it's called high conflict it talks about how good and important conflict is until it's not anymore until the moment when people start being much more concerned about winning the conflict than solving the problems that spurred the conflict of in the first place how to recognize when that's happening and how to walk back from it if it isn't achieving the goals the second thing that happened is of course last week I spent a huge amount of time trying to understand on a deep level a large piece of legislation and how complicated it is and how important it is and how good it is even though it has parts of it in it that I would rather definitely not be there in doing that I got a better idea of all of the coalitions that had to come together to form some kind of solidarity if not consensus about this then at least buy it you had to take a lot of different kinds of people with some broad alignments about big stuff but a ton of individual disagreement and get them on board for something very complex and big and meaningful the third thing is that a friend of mine died his name was John Engen he was the mayor of my town for the last 15 years long time what I know about him and all of the people I've ever seen work in my city government either elected or Not Elected did is that they have very hard jobs in which they have to listen to a lot of people and then end up doing stuff that makes no one happy because their job isn't to make one group of people happy it's to represent everyone and nothing really hits their desk unless people disagree about it I disagree really really deeply with a lot of people in my community and I'm sure that privately mayor ingen hated when he was hated and there were a lot of people who did not like him as we do with politicians and I'm sure that he was often very frustrated that despite lots of training and his best efforts people still would not hear him sometimes but he understood that the first line on the job description of being a leader was not be heard it was listen for him the first step in being heard was to listen to make sure that people were heard so that they would be more likely to hear him I think leaders all around the world do this and we have no mechanism to celebrate that or to thank them for it it is very very hard and very important work it's been hard to not be be cynical about government for a while now maybe forever but thinking some about the mechanisms for how conflict functions deeply examining some legislation that took a lot of work to build alignment on and of course having caused to examine the life of a really dedicated and talented public servant has put my brain in a different space at least for the moment which has made me feel really good about a thing that we've been doing a really long time called how to vote in every state it's a YouTube channel and also now a tick tock account where you can go and watch the video for your state it'll tell you how to get registered whether you can vote from home how to get a sample ballot how to find your polling place all the stuff you need to make your plan so that you can go and vote because voting as I said on Twitter is the butt wiping of democracy it doesn't solve all the problems and it's not the limit of what you should do but it's pretty low lift and it definitely does not help to not do it so if you or someone you know doesn't have a voting plan for this election check it out or send it to them thank you John feel better I'll see you on Tuesday good morning john today joe biden is probably going to sign the largest single piece of climate change legislation any country on our planet has ever enacted but everything i have read and i have read a lot is frustratingly thin on detail and as i tried to do the research myself on that i i discovered why i've been going over non-partisan analyses congressional budget office reports talking to the people who wrote those reports talking to the administrator of the epa even in some cases reading the actual text of the 700-page bill and what i have found has been a surprise but also a bit of the delight so let's start at the beginning [Music] around 4 billion years ago something started to be alive on earth and ever since then that life has had a profound effect on the planet photosynthesizers used sunlight to break up carbon dioxide to build their bodies out of the carbon and release the oxygen that oxygen made all kinds of interesting weird things happen including at one point killing almost everything so no life creating atmospheric change that has a profound negative impact on life not actually new over time life kept shoving energy into carbon containing molecules and then after the life died those molecules would break down and the energy would be re-released but sometimes the molecules of the dead thing would stay trapped and they wouldn't break down and they would get stuck in the earth where they'd heat up and get squished and become coal or oil or natural gas all that energy emitted by the sun grabbed by life and then stored by the earth waiting there to power your car or your refrigerator or your microsoft zoom that energy is what has powered so much of our modern lives but as we have released that energy to do things with we have also released the original molecules that it was stored inside of those complicated carbon molecules get broken down and carbon dioxide gets released it is a molecule that is opaque to a lot of infrared radiation a gas that makes our atmosphere less clear to heat and so heat that would otherwise escape no longer is there is more energy in the atmosphere and it's changing weather patterns increasing droughts and fires and storms and heat waves but unfortunately we also really need all of that energy to prevent people from dying in heat waves to make the food that people eat to move it around and to power the plane that takes me to visit my brother we can't just turn the power plants off people would start dying very quickly and they wouldn't stop for a really really long time it's messy and it's complex and like those first cyanobacteria people started to wonder if we weren't gonna just ruin it for ourselves but we are smarter than them and we are more capable of passing broad-based industrial policy with a focus on clean energy than they are barely just barely and that brings us up to now [Music] in 2005 a couple of years before this youtube channel began the us hit peak carbon emissions of 7 billion tons per year at the time that problem looked pretty insurmountable this is jesse jenkins one of the world's leading experts on modeling decarbonization efforts talking about those dark years um you know at the time if you could get a wind farm that cost less than a hundred dollars a megawatt hour which is like triple the you know normal electricity rate that was a great deal and solar was 10 times the cost of normal you know power from a gas plant or something but over the last decade you know due to supportive policies in the us but also abroad in you know china and germany and japan and elsewhere we've taken these what we used to call expensive alternative energy technologies that at the time people were worried we couldn't get you know 5 or 10 or 15 percent of our electricity from without blowing up the grid and now there are cheap trillion dollar mainstream you know technologies that are scaling rapidly and are powering you know in the case of some parts of the country the majority of our electricity on certain days i am in what seems to be a weird situation of being more optimistic now than i was 20 years ago because in that time i have seen a lot of change since this youtube channel began we have dropped from 7 billion tons to 5 billion tons emitted per year in the u.s in the next 15 years according to jesse's models which admittedly are trying to predict the future we will probably get down to 3.5 billion tons 50 lower than our peak this week i was able to talk to michael regan the head of the epa and he also talked about this optimism even when i talked to past ep administrators the role technology plays in the solutions that we're seeking the quickness of innovation and the evolution of business models matching with technology and science and data we can move much faster than we've ever moved before we are aiming for net zero carbon emissions in america by 2050 and this is the first time in my life that i have felt like that might be possible we have never undergone a shift in energy use that is anything like this maybe the original electrification of the country but we're gonna have to make this shift a lot faster than we made that shift however complex you think this is it's more complex than that in this case even for experts like we only ever get to see our own little corner of what's going on this is a big problem that no one person understands all of but in this video you're going to go from understanding more than like 80 or 90 of people to understanding this more than 99 of people it's only going to take you like 15 minutes so let's do this what's this okay i like it picasso this bill basically has three big goals and i don't see them being talked about so here's the framework with which to understand this one we are trying to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in the atmosphere two we are trying to make the impacts of climate change and pollution and also this energy shift less impactful on people or ideally a good thing for people so that they like it particularly we would like to decrease the impacts on the most disadvantaged people and third and this is important to understand anything that's going on here this is a bill that is trying to make the united states of america into an industrial center of the clean technology revolution now there are some other smaller things in the build that don't fit into any of these categories we'll talk about them in the future but that's the three big things oh look each one of these blocks is a billion dollars and there are 369 of them and we're going to start filling them up first we want to drive down the cost of installing renewable energy projects that's wind solar and grid scale batteries that's going to lower people's electricity bills and it's also going to make it so that when you plug in your electric car in the year 2027 we'll get to that the power turning your wheels is going to produce less carbon dioxide and wow we have filled up a lot of our billions all this money is here to incentivize power producers to use more wind solar and grid scale batteries that's going to reduce the amount of co2 being released in the atmosphere but also it does the second thing does that by decreasing electricity bills having minimum wage requirements and apprenticeship requirements and it does the third thing by requiring that a lot of the stuff that is going into these projects solar panels batteries wind turbines are made in america and the components are either from america or from our free trade allies if you've ever played tony hawk pro skater you know how like when you do like more than one trick in a row you can get a multiplier it's like that if you do any of these individual things you get some stuff but there's multipliers every time you do more but hank i hear you saying we don't make a lot of solar panels or wind turbines or batteries in america right now how are we going to be able to source those from america don't worry about that boom it's the second biggest thing in the build the manufacturing tax credits not only do the people buying the thing get the tax credit but so the people making the things we're building out a whole industry here 37 billion dollars is expected to go toward helping companies make solar panels and batteries and battery components and wind turbines and etcetera etcetera and they've got to be made in the u.s and they gotta hit those wage and apprenticeship requirements but hank you continue to be concerned solar power and wind power they're intermittent you can't expect them to be on all the time and those batteries they're gonna handle some of that shifting but not all of it that is right we need firm power power that you can turn on whenever you need it and the biggest piece of cash in this bill that goes toward that goes toward existing nuclear power plants helping them stay open and keep operating existing carbon free electricity with tax breaks but only if you meet wage and apprenticeship requirements probably just expect that everything you hear about is going to have wage and apprenticeship requirements because this bill has to be good for people and also there need to be people to work on these things so you need to be training people and you need to be paying them well also focused on firm power are smaller investments in potential future technologies like advanced nuclear power advanced geothermal and advanced biofuels we don't know which of those things is going to be the best or most impactful but all of them could end up being important players in carbon-free firm power all right so now this hypothetical person who's basically constructing the bill with me is concerned that we're giving a lot of money to power plants not a lot of money to people how about 22 billion dollars for you and another 14 billion after that and then 12 billion after that the 22 billion dollars goes to help people upgrade their appliances in their homes like water heaters furnaces stoves and even just their electrical boxes to handle all of that new electricity because guess what you might not have noticed your house currently has an exhaust pipe it is extremely likely that you have power coming into your house in two ways the electricity that powers the lights and the microwave and your microsoft zune and then there's the gas power that powers your furnace and your water heater and maybe your stovetop possibly even your clothes dryer all of that means that your house chugs out co2 and there isn't an easy way to clean that up without replacing those methane burning appliances with appliances that run on electricity if you can't do that not only are you just releasing a lot of carbon dioxide also you're reliant on a single source of fuel for your heat and your hot water and that fuel price can fluctuate a lot while electricity costs don't fluctuate as much and those fluctuations hit low income people extra hard because fuel costs and energy costs are a higher portion of what they spend their money on so this 22 billion goes toward helping people buy and in some cases outright covering the entire cost of appliances that electrify these previously gas-powered things heat pumps to heat and cool homes using electricity heat pump water heaters electric or induction stovetops just buying one of these appliances saves people money in the long term already folks usually can't afford the upfront costs of that especially doing all of these things at the same time well no longer the next 14 billion are to help people and property owners make their buildings more efficient and these last 12 billion are for you guessed it electric vehicle tax credits that you probably can't use i know what you're thinking all that sounded so great until that last part why can i not use my electric vehicle tax credit because of the third thing these cars also have manufacturing requirements and when this bill goes into effect the number of cars that will qualify for that is quite small and they will all be sold very quickly now there were already tax credits on electric vehicles but those credits only apply for the first 200 000 vehicles from each manufacturer and many manufacturers gm tesla etc have already burned through all those this extends those indefinitely for the next 10 years but only if they meet the requirements because again the bill is about all three things other countries have had this kind of industrial policy for decades and that has allowed them to build up their industries producing these things and the people who crafted this bill for better or worse want the u.s to have that kind of industrial policy it now looks like we are more than halfway through the things that this build does but we are not down here things start to get much more dense uh and then you realize that there are actually hundreds of ways that this bill spends money and each one of them does a different thing for different people in different places like hank what about the carbon impact of forest fires yeah that is in there how about decarbonizing airplane fuels yeah early stages in trying to get that done that's in there converting garbage trucks and city buses to electric it definitely does that tax incentives for existing power plants to capture their emissions yeah three billion dollars for that electrifying most of the postal service fleet another three billion for that reconnecting communities that were divided by the interstate highway system yes 3 billion for that too helping farmers figure out systems for sequestering carbon in their fields sure cleaning up and electrifying port infrastructure definitely that early market creation for low carbon building materials also in there new transmission lines because all of this electrification is going to require more robust grid yeah that too charging stations for evs got that as well grants for tribes to invest in clean energy got that too buying debt from rural power co-ops if they promise to shut down their carbon emitting power plants and giving them money to build new infrastructure that's in there too there's a lot of things that are trying to do really specific individual things but there's also big hunks in here that aren't prescriptive it's money for communities to do things that they want to do to decrease their impact here's epa administer michael regan again talking about that a lot of these grant dollars that are in the act we're able to give those to community groups who are partnering with universities and incubation centers the matching dollars and the low interest loans are available to people who have never been at the table if we get these universities and these these these young adults these incubation centers really tackling these issues with community groups on the ground these solutions can look a thousand and one different ways and we have to feed all of these solutions to see which ones work for each individual community we don't have to accept the notion that there's a one size fit all you can look a thousand and one different ways but hank this hypothetical person who was walking me through this entire bill is now asking me why are we doing all of these individual things instead of just doing the one thing if you did one thing it would do everything and that's just to make fossil fuels more expensive gretchen stop trying to make fetch happen it's not going to happen a few years ago an ex-lobbyist from exxonmobil was caught on video saying this nobody is going to to propose a tax on all americans and the cynical side of me says yeah we kind of know that but it gives us a talking point that we can say well what is exxon mobil for well we're for a carbon tax here's the thing we passed this bill staring down the highest inflation rate in decades and five dollar per gallon gas there are two ways to incentivize the move toward clean energy we can make clean energy cheaper and we can make fossil fuels more expensive and with people already having a hard time getting their butts to work nobody in congress was going to keep their jobs if they intentionally made fuel costs go up this bill is very nearly all carrots for clean energy and just a few sticks for fossil fuels but i will talk about those sticks now because one of them i love very much methane is the most simple carbon containing molecule and it is even better at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over the short term it's 80 times better at trapping heat and as we've moved away from coal and toward natural gas which is basically just methane that has been good because methane is a more efficient fuel you get more heat per carbon dioxide molecule that you release except that at every step of the way methane can leak into the atmosphere at the wellhead at the pipeline at the compressor at the infrastructure that delivers it to your house and the facilities that use it the methane emissions reduction program provides incentives to fix leaks and acquire more advanced systems for keeping methane from being released and it also pays for teams to check and see if there are methane leaks and charge increasingly hefty fines to the companies that are releasing this entirely usable potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere those fines go up and up and up until they generate a fairly significant amount of revenue as it forces these companies to clean up their app the other sticks against fossil fuels are fairly minor they reinstate the superfund tax which is basically a big pool of money that polluters pay into and that money is then used to rehabilitate the damage that they do to the environment it is a super fund when i was a kid i thought it was the super fund program it's not that there's also an increase in the percentage of money that the government gets back from oil companies when they take oil and gas off of federal land and finally there's an increase in the cost of holding a lease without developing it so just having it sit there and not using it there's an increase in that cost both of those are basically ways to disincentivize companies from using federal lands to produce oil and gas so there are a couple of things to keep fossil fuels a little more under control but mostly we want their cost to remain steady or even go down as demand for them decreases because the alternatives are just better but also weirdly there's a couple of carrots for fossil fuels [Music] since we are obsessed with anything and everything that makes us feel bad if you've heard anything about this bill you have heard that joe manchin moderate democrat forced the inclusion of a few very weird provisions first and most frustratingly he took a few oil and gas leases in alaska and the gulf of mexico that trump had authorized and then biden had paused and people have been fighting against for years and was like you want my name on this you make those leases happen it's super weird it's super frustrating it's outside of the normal process no one likes this except for of course the oil and gas companies in joe manchin and the other thing was basically a way to prevent any president or lawmakers in the next 10 years from banning fossil fuel leases on federal land and it does this by tying the ability to put clean energy projects on federal land to a requirement to offer leases for oil and gas drilling on other separate federal land now an offered lease is not a sold lease and a sold lease is not an oil well but it is still disappointing kind of gets stuck in your throat even if modelers show that the overall carbon effectiveness of the bill only goes down by about two percent because of these provisions but imagine i guess got what he wanted out of it which is everyone talking more about how he loves fossil fuels and they're his pretty little baby than the entire rest of the bill and also he got to be like one of the title names on the bill despite being one of its biggest opponents so ah so now the right question to ask is is all of this going to work and luckily i have prepared for you more squares each one of these is roughly 5 million fewer tons of co2 and by 2030 there are 200 of them so that's roughly a billion fewer tons of carbon dioxide per year here's where we'll be decreased co2 and transportation saves us 280 million tons per year cleaner power generation saves us 360 million tons cleaner industry saves us 130 million cleaner buildings save us around 70 million tons same for the equivalent carbon dioxide effects of mostly methane but also other greenhouse gases produced by cars like nitric oxides and finally carbon sequestration in agricultural and forest lands gets us a final 80 million tons and of course we do not pause there the effects of these changes are projected to get us down another 500 million tons by 2035. i'm aware that there are going to be people who are going to be mad at me for being pretty unapologetically excited about this bill like i'm mad that we lost the civilian climate corps which would have been thousands of young people working on the ground on these problems i am frustrated that we lost a lot of due process on these oil leases and they weren't even something that i was actively working on so i can't imagine what it must be like for the people who've been fighting those battles look i don't know if it's that i'm old now or that i'm privileged in like a thousand ways or that i've been through a number of climate fights that went very badly maybe i'm just thinking practically about the fact that this might be our last chance to get something substantial done for years like many years maybe especially because there was every likelihood that this could have just not happened like many other parts of the original buildback better didn't happen in fact four measly weeks ago it seemed like it wouldn't happen i got to talk to jesse jenkins about that i was on vacation with my family or leaving for vacation and i got the call from senator schumer's staff that the bill was dead same faces of grief right shock loss anger and some people stopped at anger and they just got mad at joe manchin on the internet and and yelled at you know he got cynical like you were talking about and some of us um including some members of you know a few handful of members of the senate again said no this is not how it's going to end i refuse to accept that so this is also bargaining right that's one of the faces of grief and we went back to work and we bargained and it against all odds it worked i had pretty well given up hope that it was going to succeed at that point given this is the second time the rug was pulled out from under us you know i wanted to be able to tell my kids that we we fought to the very end and it worked um and i am so grateful uh i'm gonna cheer up a little for all the people really that that did that because it was very very close to failure i don't harbor any illusions that i live in a perfect world or a perfect country or that perfect legislation exists there are 330 million of us the fact that we get anything done at all is a little impressive and over the last 10 years we have made tremendous strides in cutting carbon emissions and that has been in large part because of government investment in the us and elsewhere between 2009 and 2017 america spent around 20 billion dollars per year fighting climate change over the next 10 years we will spend 80 billion dollars per year there are a lot of super powerful people who have been working really hard this whole time to slow this down as much as they can at first they say it doesn't exist then they say it's not caused by people then they say it's caused by people but it's not that big of a deal then they say it's that big of a deal but the costs to take it on are too great we have hit them with reality at every step in that process and we're gonna hit them with reality at this step of the process too they will tell us that the costs are too great and after we prove to them that it's not they will tell us that it's too late nothing gets done if you don't believe it can't be done and i for the first time in decades of this have started to believe that it can be done and it's happening i think for two reasons one because of the very hard work of a lot of people from policy to science to communication and outreach and two because it is getting hard to ignore the very real effects of all of this extra energy in our atmosphere and in our oceans we might be in a very narrow window here a moment when the effects are too present for anyone to ignore anymore but not so present that they will hold us back from implementing solutions i don't know how long that window's gonna be open and i was not sure that it was open until somebody did something and said something and they kept working and they kept pushing and they kept making the case that this needed to be done until it got done but now it feels like the window's open it does not feel like we are done one big step does not get you over the mountain pass there is much more to do but as i've been saying i am more optimistic now that this is a challenge that we can actually take on than i have been maybe in my entire career john i'll see you on tuesday heads up my full interviews with jesse jenkins and administrator regan are up over on hank's channel i learned a ton from both of them they're fascinating conversations there's links in the description and also just a general thank you to everyone and there are thousands of you who worked in some way on this bill either advocating or writing or doing policy analysis like it's a big thing both on my behalf but also on behalf of like my son who's going to be around for more of this future and i want his future to be one that i can believe and one where the fair rides that he loves so much are powered by clean energy and you're helping with that so thanks good morning john happy esther day i love you and here's a wonderful thing this is getting easier and i have some ideas about why if i try and look deeply at why it's hard to say i love you to you but easier to say it to mom or catherine or oren first of all the main thing is it's very hard to say why we do or feel anything humans are both very complicated and very simple and the complicated parts make it hard to see the simple parts i'm going to try though the simplest answer here is that saying i love you leaves you very vulnerable it's like saying you have the power to hurt me so so much and like i'm not consciously worried about you hurting me i'm not even really i don't think subconsciously worried about you hurting me but i think i at one point in the past was brothers can have competitive sometimes antagonistic relationships that's certainly been the case in the past for us it's been a long time since our relationship has been traditionally like zero-sum competitive but to some extent it once was and like that's in the foundation right that's down there our relationship is built over time and and there's stuff that is there from the whole time right it's all in there and i think the way that that foundation has continued to affect however it has constructed itself over time has been like you know it's about collaboration it's about earning each other's respect it's about being impressed by each other that's a lot not all of what our relationship has been built on for a long time and i love you doesn't really fit into the shape of that relationship instead of i'm proud of you i really like that thing that you made it's i don't care what you do i love you you are my brother and i will always love you and care about it's a completely different playing field and it's a good playing field it's just not where we have traditionally spent time so it's uncomfortable so with all that out there here's why i think it might be getting easier first we're getting older and accomplishment and competition are just more tempered i think the old playing field seems a little less valuable this new one seems a little more present second maybe you have always been but i am more aware of the fact that all of this is temporary there's just a deeper truer thing than like earning each other's respect through accomplishment and that thing is going to be more and more important in the future and third and god bless her for it esther made us practice those of you who don't know esther earl was a member of our community early on and she died of cancer in 2010 when her friends and family asked how she would like her birthday to be celebrated after she was gone she said she wanted it to be like a time to celebrate non-romantic love like a valentine's day but for all the other kinds of love pretty much the best answer she possibly could have given the first time you do anything new it's gonna be hard and oftentimes if it's out of your typical experience it's hard the fifth time but now it's been like 12 times and that is a gift that's a good gift a couple of yesterday updates tonight at eight pm eastern time there's going to be a live stream that will feature uh some people from this star won't go out esther's family and john and sarah and the animal wonders folks and there's also this beautiful t-shirt designed by karen hallion all the proceeds from that go to this star won't go out which is a charity that helps families with sick kids john i love you i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so probably you have heard that for a long time the amount of energy entering the earth's atmosphere and the amount leaving the earth's atmosphere was about the same and that was good because if those two numbers are not equal then we're either getting colder every year or we're getting hotter every year but now it looks like there is in fact more energy coming in than going out and that results in basically three things first more heat which is what we call like individual molecules moving faster which is wild like when you are hot it is because the molecules that make up your body are jiggling more doesn't seem real but it is second you have more severe weather which is when a lot of molecules together move around more and because of those two you have number three which is probably the worst of them things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that when that stuff changes crops might have dramatically lower yields resulting in very hungry people people might use their air conditioners way more than in the past so entire power grids fail or forests that grew in areas that once had shorter dry seasons might burn up in fires so that's bad and always the first thing you should ask when something bad is happening is why is that happening well you know when you go outside wearing a black t-shirt you get hotter faster than if you're wearing a white t-shirt that's because things only look black if they absorb all of the visible light that is hitting them if the light was not being absorbed it would either be reflected as white light or as a mirror or it would be clear which would be a strange choice for a shirt so if you're wearing a white shirt the visible light isn't being absorbed it's being reflected and that's why you're less hot absorb reflect or let pass through that's basically the only three things that a material can do with light and if the light is being absorbed that means the energy of the light hit the molecule in such a way that it's creating movement in the molecule the light no longer exists the energy is now movement and that movement can be transferred to other molecules just like a cue ball hitting a pool ball there are basically two ways a molecule can heat up and we just talked about both of them the first is that a photon travels through space and then gets absorbed by a molecule and speeds up that molecule that's heat from radiation and the second way is that a particle that's jiggling a lot hits a particle that's jiggling less and transfers its heat to that other molecule when that happens in a solid we call it conduction when it happens in a fluid we call it convection so like when you're in the shade 99 of the heat you are feeling is from convection it's molecules in the air running into you and transferring their heat to you but when you're in the sun it's a mix of both the radiation and the convection which is why it's hotter in the sun now different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light like this book cover is mostly absorbing everything but yellow and this one is mostly absorbing everything but red and the red and the yellow are being reflected back and this can also happen with gases there can be green gases and yellow gases and brown gases but the two molecules of interest here carbon dioxide and methane they don't absorb any light in the visible spectrum which means that they are clear we can't see them one of the problems with methane actually if your house is filling up with it you need to make sure that you know that that's happening but you can't see it but at certain infrared wavelengths which the sun creates a lot of they are black and when we put more of them in the atmosphere our atmosphere is a little less clear in those wavelengths and it's a little more black those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise cooler denser air rushes in to take its place and that's weather now those hot air molecules might remove more moisture from the soil resulting in more wildfires they might evaporate more water from the ocean resulting in bigger storms we know that this happens we know how this happens we know why this happens and we know what the effects are and we know that the only way to stop it is for there to be less co2 and methane in the atmosphere but that is a very hard thing to do it's very hard and expensive to remove those things from the atmosphere it's very hard and very expensive to replace the agriculture and energy and transportation infrastructure that results in the release of those gases it is not an easy problem to solve but we have a very strong grip on what the problem is and i think people can solve basically any problem if only we can agree that it exists john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so probably you have heard that for a long

on what the problem is and i think people can solve basically any problem if only we can agree that it exists john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John we just got the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope and a lot of people it seems are feeling a bit small right now maybe humbled maybe insignificant but here's something weird I'm actually not sure if I feel very small right now or very big so when you look at a structure like the cosmic Cliffs with seven light year tall Peaks or a Deep Field image that you cannot put your pinky finger on without covering several galaxies it makes sense to think okay so why do we think that anything that happens here on Earth matters at all and there are really good human answers to that question answer is like we give our universe meaning we matter to each other but there are also maybe some like kind of objective answers would we understand that an area in the sky the size of a grain of sand contains thousands of galaxies that each contain billions of stars and we say I feel insignificant now that is not a way of saying nothing matters it's an instinct that something matters but that that mattering is spread throughout what appears to be a basically infinite universe and so we don't matter something matters just not us because we are too small to matter but I wonder is size the right measure I've got a kind of okay understanding of how the universe works like not great but maybe a bit better than average and one thing that seems to be basically the case is that there are a bunch of practically infinite fields that cause particles to exist and interact in a number of ways and as evidenced by the presence of oxygen and hydrogen Spectra in galaxies billions of light years away the rules appear to be consistent throughout the whole universe now this is all very complicated but it's also not it's just physics doing physics things but while the universe is astoundingly Big indeed very possibly infinite in size it's not that big in time now you might say Hank actually 13.7 billion years seemed like a very long time like practically infinite but no the universe is Young compared to both infinity and compared to its eventual lifespan life on Earth is one continual chemical system that dates back 3.7 billion years which means that this wild Frolic that includes everything from Brachiosaurus to BTS has existed for 27 of the lifetime of the universe we do not take up much space but we have taken up a lot of time so that's one way we are bigger than we might think but here's another the vast majority of the particles in the universe do not know they exist they have never wanted something they've never looked at something and found it beautiful they have never built a space telescope and when I say like vast majority I mean that the number of particles that are part of any system with wants and Sensations is so small that they may as well be ignored but we can agree they should not be ignored because they are very strange and very different and very beautiful and they know things about themselves and about each other in your head you have around the same number of neurons as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy and those neurons are much smaller than stars but they are in fact more ordered and you could argue that each one is more complex if you think galaxies are amazing just wait until you find out about you now are we the only chemical system to have built a space telescope no the way I understand the universe that is an impossibility but it also does not seem very common for the universe to find paths toward waking up and to be a part of that it feels very big John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John so probably in part because I take a medicine to control an autoimmune disease I got a special kind of covid that goes away and then it comes back again it's a bit of a struggle that has me looking for for the bright side of things and I did finally lose my sense of smell slash taste and and you don't actually lose your your taste you got your sour Bitter Sweet salty Umami you keep those but you lose all of the complexity of the nose you get five tastes but yet like tens of thousands of smell it's amazing and for whatever reason it stopped working in me and this has made me curious because I like most foods but there are some foods that I literally just taste like poison to me and I wonder if without the smell component of taste which is a big part of taste will I still dislike that things that I dislike tend to be vinegary and vinegar is very sour so my guess is that if I eat something vinegary I'm gonna still hate it but you never know ah I have never enjoyed a pickle so let's see what happens that's very bad there's a lot of bitterness I'm sitting here though and now I kind of want more of it oh no I also like all rational people don't understand why people have black licorice so let's crack that open as well it sounds really delicious right on the label so that's a big hunk okay oh absolutely fantastic I hate black licorice this is great they're just sweet of course they're sweet and then there's like a nice mix of a bitter sour that's doing a great job of complementing the sweetness wow that's great oh my gosh it's really delicious if my sense of smell never comes back I will take everybody's black licorice everything that's good all right I'm also not a fan of blue cheese so in order to make sure I'm doing the Lord's work here let's get a big like way more than I would ever eat this even of a normal cheese oh that's good shockingly sweet very salty wow that's good whoa whoa blue cheese is great when you can't smell I would never have thought that it would be sweet I might eat all of that I'm gonna get some crackers I guess is that I'm still not gonna like anchovies just how I didn't like pickles because they're basically just pickles but fish instead of cucumbers but you never know three two one oh God ah there's no water in here oh my God I'm a spit machine right now oh uh that's clearly an ingredient it's not a thing you eat on its own in that package of anchovies there's 74 of your daily salt so that's not that's not a good food all right now for the Moment of Truth uh there's a lot left in my bag here but all of it is olives we're gonna start off with black olives I don't know which olives are more Olive who knows maybe they're good without smell this is an olive well it's not vinegary at all it's just salty that's good that's what an olive tasted like I would eat all this salty it's got a little little bit of something like a like a richness maybe it's just fatty like a fatty flavor that's quite nice and then the salt is a little much that's a good that was a good experience I figured I was gonna hate that honestly and to finish this off I believe designed specifically for people who do not have a sense of taste it's blue cheese stuffed green olives I'm gonna make a prediction I'm gonna say these are gonna be too salty why do I keep smelling things anyway ah very salty but the cheese brings a lot of like sweetness and sourness to it and that's great that's great that's good it's a good texture the cheese is a really nice texture to it there is something there now I feel like I'm getting in my in my smell Zone there's not Olive flavor it's like a rich nutty feeling that's delish if you like the flavor of Olives olives would be great but unfortunately for me when I can actually taste them they taste like poison John thanks for hanging out as I search for some bright side and it is this I got to eat olives without hating them and black licorice too that was my favorite part because honestly not a lot of bright sides to this almost as if covid really sucks obviously feeling a little bit better now but main thing from my experience rest lay down no pressure convalesce and that's what I've mostly been doing John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning john i have not left this room in about a week like i have not gone out that door which is you know not great luckily it is a child suite which means that i have there's quite a long walk i can do just from one one end of the room to the other i did actually spend a little bit of time in the top bunk just to alleviate borden i also spent some time over here it's a nice little spot at first i was honestly like oh this ain't so bad i'm gonna get a lot of stuff done it turns out no i have cover and that's meant not a lot of motivation and a lot of sleep i'm doing covered tests i'm doing one right now and it's also meant a lot of watching i have a giant tv look at this giant tv it's huge and i can connect it to my phone i can watch anything that my phone can do so the last like five and a half years since oren was born i think i've seen six movies parasite knives out little women coco and kanto and into the spider verse and i decided i'd just go ahead and double that in a matter of days and so since i have nothing better to do here's seven movie reviews in four minutes i started out with dune and i was pretty fevery at this point so i'm not sure if she should take my opinion super seriously i've also watched a lot of dune content over the years i sort of had the thought while i was watching it why like it felt a lot like all of the other dune things i've consumed if the answer to why is because movies look better now they're prettier than yes okay i accept it looks very good the vibes are very strong i'm definitely gonna watch the next one i cried one time during this movie second we watched shang chi which i really loved i was really in it i did start to think that maybe i'm a little bit over superhero movies and their ability to turn every single plot point into a fight or chase scene i know that that's the whole point of a superhero movie so like it's not on shanghai but i cried two times during this movie one was because of katie the other was because of a dragon third suggested by sam reich was derek delgadio's in and of itself which was the best thing maybe i've ever seen this a live audience one man show kept my attention better than shang chi and its thousand intricately choreographed fight scenes i did not look away from the screen for a moment it was definitely the best 90 minutes i have spent in this hotel room i cried maybe 300 times and saying that that was my favorite thing was something because of number four everything everywhere all at once which i have heard lots about and for the first like 30 minutes maybe i was like yeah yeah this is what i was expecting they didn't just make a cerebral sci-fi kung fu thriller and they didn't just make it hilarious and absurd they also made it all about the only thing that matters which is people loving each other and those rocks the rocks john i was so worried that they were gonna do this thing to me but they didn't do the thing to me and then they went and got that raccoon accurate count of number of cries gotta be in the double digits number five uh lighthouse i get why people suggested that i watch it but i will remind you i'm trapped in a hotel room really good movie at letting you know what it feels like to be insane my subconscious did put me to sleep during it like i had to pause and go back a while because i fell asleep which worries me like what what about that did you find relaxing i did not cry during this movie number six detective pikachu which i watched directly after lighthouse for some reason but in a weird way not knowing very much about pokemon a similar kind of fever dream frankly i was delighted i was not surprised by all but one of the plot twists the guy who does the voice of pikachu a plus great and i cried zero times but it almost got me it really did and our final film was palm springs which i did not know about until craig benzene told me about it i think a lot of people might hear like the synopsis of this one and be like well i've already seen groundhog day and no very different but you know also funny and touching and extremely clever a lot of conversations we're bound to be having right now i liked it a lot and i cried one time john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john you are not eating a credit card's worth of microplastics a week now you might not have been worried about that but a lot of people are and that makes sense because a lot of very credible news organizations have run stories saying that you are eating a credit card's worth of microplastics every week the fact that this definitely untrue statement was spread in so many legitimate news organizations has been quite annoying to me but it's also been something of a curiosity to me like these places do fact check they don't just publish whatever comes across their desk itself knowing that it is almost always better to lean into curiosity than frustration i did that and what i found is remarkable this was an 11 step process step one the world wildlife fund is worried about plastics and they should be there are too many way too many single-use plastics and we need to stop this so step two the wwf commissioned a study from the university of newcastle to do a literature review basically look at a bunch of different studies that measured how plastics might enter people and then add all of those sources up every study that they reviewed had a different range they added all those ranges up and they came to their own range of 0.1 grams to 5 grams of plastic ingested every week and this isn't useful data to the average person it's just too imprecise it's like saying that the average person eats between one pound and 50 pounds of food per day the wwf then did a normal thing they used the study they commissioned to create a talking point people could be consuming five grams of microplastics per week this is not a lie but it's kind of a misrepresentation it's kind of misleading all this happened in 2019 and none of it reached very far because headlines that said you could be eating a credit card of plastic per week is like well i could be eating a thousand spiders per night tell me when you're sure no one wrote that people definitely were eating a credit card's worth of plastic per week until 2022 why step number four scientists at the medical university of vienna were among those who were misled they took the upper bound of the estimate the five grams and used it as just a background stat in the introduction to their pain when they did that they removed the context of the lower bound they didn't say 0.1 grams 25 grams they just said five grams it didn't have anything to do with their methodology or what they were studying it was just a background stat and that's not really what people paid the most attention to when they're doing peer review so step six peer review didn't catch it step number seven that publication then got run through the university pr team which is tasked with presenting research in ways that might be interesting to the average person and to the press and unsurprisingly the very first sentence in that press release was five grams of plastic particles on average entered the human gastrointestinal tract per person per week because indeed if that were true it would be a very interesting statistic so you're going to put it at the beginning of your press release so now we have a press release of a peer-reviewed paper that says that people on average eat a credit card's worth of plastic every week step number eight less than a week later gut news.com had found that press release and published a headline containing the claim step number nine that article spread fast enough that the very next day the new york post published an article with the claim in the headlines step number 10 legitimate news outlets saw the new york post article and they were like well we can't just publish that because the new york post lies for a living but we will do a fact check and they did and they found a peer-reviewed paper that contained the claim peer-reviewed article plus a really great headline that's going to be good enough for them step number 11 it was a really good headline so lots of people clicked on it and lots of people shared it meaning it wasn't just published it spread when i first saw this headline i was super lucky because it was in the new york post and i know to be skeptical of the new york post but if you saw it first at usa today or abc news or nautilus all totally legitimate news organizations and if you're like primed by this world to believe that everything is as bad as could possibly be i totally understand not being skeptical of that headline it is kind of wild to me how many steps and how many mistakes were made along the way in order for this false fact to get published in mainstream news outlets every person in their own way is trying to make sense of the world and we would like the sense that we make of the world to be based on reality even though we've built up many systems for doing that as individuals and as a society our own very normal biases and the realities of what it takes to capture people's attention these days makes sense-making a monster of a challenge john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i think a medicine that increases my chances of getting skin cancer so every year i have to go see a dermatologist to check and make sure that all my skin cells are acting all nice and respectful and none of them are stepping out of line and trying to kill me so far this has always gone fine that one time they did take a biopsy of a thing in my foot only to discover that it was pieces of a pinecone that i stepped on when i was in high school at my most recent dermatology visit there was a med student in the room doing one of the 20 000 things you have to do in order to become a doctor you wrap it all up they leave i put my clothes back on i walk outside and she says i just want to thank you so much for crash course and that feels so good every single time even if they just saw my butt and this happens frequently yesterday i was at the coffee shop with oren because it's his first day of summer vacation two people thank me for crash course one of them is starting nursing school this week john when we started crash course i certainly hoped that it would be successful in helping students learn and i couldn't have told you that it would be successful and i much less could have told you why it would be successful but now i do understand that and i want to explain it to you we started crash courses youtubers which i didn't think about at the time but it turns out that really mattered because when you're on youtube you have to compete in a very specific environment and there's two ways you can beat one you have to grab and hold on to people's attention and second you have to do it inexpensively because on youtube you make like 10 to 100 times less per minute of content you produce than on television now to make educational content hold onto people's attention you just have to make it really good you have to be conveying a lot of information to people keep their attention keep them from looking at the sidebar and getting distracted to do it inexpensively you have to basically take out everything that isn't doing that and that is what created crash courses laser focus on what we talk about all the time now which is lowering barriers to education and there are from where i set two major barriers to learning one is access can you afford it is it available where you are were you accepted into the program etc but second and often ignored is the actual barrier of learning the world is complex and you need well-trained experts to get complicated ideas into other people's heads if it were easy people wouldn't be taking out tens of thousands of dollars of student loans to get it done crash course lowers that barrier as much as it can by being as good as it can be by finding the stories to tell the ways to contextualize the information in ways that matter to students by emulating some of the style of the content that they are already familiar with an appreciation that first barrier the barrier to access we solve that by not just being free but by being available to everyone who has an internet connection and a strong understanding of the english language but we have done of course in arabic and we're working on a biology course in spanish right crash course is on youtube because it is where people are it is where students are and teachers and learners because everybody's on youtube they spend time there they feel comfortable there they understand the interface it's in a place they are already choosing to spend time we can't be out there trying to sell our stuff to school districts and they buy all of it and then it kind of gets forced on the teachers no we just want to be there and let teachers and students pick what they want to choose so that the only time that crash course gets used is when students or teachers find it useful and if my inability to get a mold check without someone thanking crash course for helping them get through their education is any indication i think that crash course has a pretty big impact the entire goal has to be about optimizing learning for learning about getting those barriers down as low as we can get them you can't eliminate them but you can get them lower and why is that important because the entire human story is about how effective we are at helping each other learn but pushing those barriers down isn't easy we reach a lot of people at crash course and we try to keep our budget low but it costs a lot of money 37 percent of our budget comes from our patreon and from the crash course coin a beautiful coin minted in arkansas from hand engraved dies we've sold out of the 10 000 learner coins but the 2022 2000 learner coins are still available and will be through this weekend but then never ever again if you want to help crash course do this work and you have a hundred dollars to spare and i totally understand if you do not there's a link in the description john i'll see you on tuesday [Music] you good morning john everyone is talking about student loans incorrectly and it's making me frustrated so i'm making a video about some flat decontextualized numbers for you there's 1.75 trillion dollars of outstanding student debt in america held by around 45 million students that is roughly 39 000 of debt per student and what you would imagine given those numbers and what most people do imagine is the average college graduate headed out to the workforce with 39 000 of debt and this is entirely wrong first let us not forget about the 35 of people who get a degree and do not have student loans that number was a lot bigger than i expected it to be and i think it's important to say that it exists and that those people have like a leg up on the 65 percent of the students who graduate with that second this won't surprise you but you may not have noticed it the average student debt holder didn't just graduate they graduated a while ago and they have either been paying down their student debt or they haven't been in which case it's actually gone up due to interest so the 39 thousand dollars isn't what they come out with it's what is left after having been paid down so but even weirder the average student graduating from a four-year college or university has about 28 000 of student debt so it is strange that the average student debt holder has 39 000 of student debt what's going on here graduate school is mostly what's going on here here's the weirdest plot twist in all of this people who take out more student loans are less likely to default on their student loans much less likely in fact as you take out more and more student loans you become less and less likely to default on them so i guess we figured it out students just need to take out more student loans and everything will be better no something weird is going on here and we have to figure out what it is what is the weird thing that's going on well first people with a lot of student loans tend to be doctors and lawyers so that's one bit of this the bigger more surprising more upsetting reason that this is the case is that 40 of people with student loans dropped out without getting a degree this is a wide variety of kinds of people but they are more likely to be black and hispanic they are more likely to have gone to a high school in a low-income area they're more likely to be older when they start college and they're more likely to be first-generation students and their loans tend to be smaller because they tend to go to cheaper schools for not as long loan delinquency for this group is quadruple loan delinquency for people who graduated now again there are lots of reasons why people might be in bad situations with regard to their student loans and it's often not because they didn't graduate but this seems like a cohort that we don't talk about and a problem that we don't interface with very much and it is a very big problem like i'll say it again 40 of people with student loans are not going to get a degree this all happens for predictable reasons the biggest one being financial pressure college doesn't just cost the money you're spending but also your near-term lost income which is vital to many people and the support that they have to give to their families and the second biggest cause academic disqualification is caused by students not getting a good enough high school education being under-supported or over-committed during school there are a lot of hard parts and failures in higher education but taking billions and billions of dollars per year of financed money from students who aren't going to end up with a degree like that's astounding and it is infuriating to me this is the exact problem that crash course and arizona state university are trying to take on with our partnership providing structures to help students make good decisions earlier in their higher education process so they don't end up making expensive mistakes and also helping them learn information that they may not have been taught well in high school or may have forgotten since this is a very common outcome at some schools it is the most common outcome and i do not understand why we don't talk about it more because the result of not talking about it is understanding the student debt crisis entirely and correctly when we forgive debt 40 of the people whose debt is being forgiven are people who didn't end up with a degree students that didn't fail but were failed and on average people who have debt and no degree have around thirteen thousand dollars of debt we need to take on the student loan crisis and we also need to take on the dropout rate crisis not just with one-time debt forgiveness but by supporting students who are working to make their lives better john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john around 10 years ago i was scheduled to make a video on december 14 2012. i had a whole idea for it and then the sandy hook attack happened and i did not know what to do so i made a short video trying to be honest about where i was in that moment and i just went back and watched that video and my takeaway from that is that in that moment the unique tragedy of sandy hook felt very unique there had been other mass shootings and school shootings that created terror and horror and tragedy but like a young adult walking into an elementary school with an ar-15 i could not imagine that and this time we had all imagined it we'd spent 10 years imagine it we've spent 10 years preparing children for it i got a letter from our school yesterday talking about the precautions they take and like no like there aren't any precautions we can't put the responsibility on schools to handle men with weapons of war we cannot educate our children in bank vaults we can't put razor wire around the playground it feels like this country is being constantly re-traumatized and that is made worse when we ask our leaders to try out some solutions and we hear some of them respond now is not the time for politics and this phrase can be heard in two very different ways because one definition of politics is the stuff we do to govern and by that measure this is certainly the time for politics because political leaders are elected to implement policy and a majority of americans want meaningful policy changes when it comes to gun safety but of course there's also another meaning to the word politics it's the game it's the jockeying for favorability politics as theater manipulating the electorate and doing all your fundraising and i agree with that this is not the time for theater it's the time for the other kind of politics the actual doing things kind but instead when they say this is not the time for politics what they're doing is the second kind of politics they're waiting until we get over it until the news cycle gets done with it and simultaneously they're saying americans who have concerns about gun safety they're not worried about kids they're just playing politics and that is disgusting the fear of having your child not come home from school one day is just about the biggest possible fear and so it seems like people who oppose gun safety legislation or want to use it as a wedge issue have had to match that with a similarly big fear but what fear could be that big how could the fear of taking away not even your current assault rifle but your right to buy one in the future in any way match the fear of having your child taken away well what about the fear of having everything taken away so that's what many of them resort to their argument is often literally that americans need guns to fight against their government people who want gun safety legislation want their leaders to take this problem seriously and it's not like it isn't a problem because guns are now the number one killer of people under the age of 19. but after sandy hook when bans on assault rifles or universal background checks were proposed the counter to the fear of losing your child in a school shooting was the fear that your government is a menace that cannot be trusted and so you must be armed to protect yourself against them this is a fringe belief that has been promoted by politicians and pundits in order to create a wedge that can help them win elections sandy hook has a lot of legacies but the politicians and pundits who took the absolutely legitimate interest americans had in gun safety legislation and used it as a wedge not just to fight that legislation but to delegitimize the government that they are sworn to uphold that is the very worst of the second kind of politics and every time they say this is not the time for politics that's the kind of politics i hear your job is to take this country's problems seriously not to drum up fear to manipulate others into hating and being terrified of their fellow citizens and their government so that you can win a primary john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john there's a little section of sidewalk that i walk down pretty frequently and i think that what happens is there's a convenience store nearby people pick up like a bag of chips or a drink and then when they're walking home sometimes they drop the thing on the ground after they're done with it i do not like this it makes me upset it makes me feel like i'm like surrounded by people who do not respect the space that we share and that is irrational it takes one person walking back and forth to the store every day and dropping a piece of trash on the ground for there to be 30 pieces of trash after a month that's a lot of trash it changes the way that it looks but it also might be one person of the hundreds of people who go to that convenience store every day so like almost no one litters but the street is covered with trash and here's the way of thinking about this that really changed my mind it only takes one person every day picking up two pieces of trash for there to be no trash after two weeks one of the best tools i have ever been taught for how to understand our world is that we often like our minds imagine the world as like set quantities but actually set quantities are made up of inputs and outputs a street with no glitter is not a street that never gets littered on it's a street where the rate of people dropping trash is lower than the rate of people picking up trash it's a flow in and out litter goes down litter goes and the person who dropped the trash is only half of the reason that the trash is there the other half of the reason is that i didn't pick it up i'm not like equally morally responsible for the trash on the ground but i don't really care about morality here i care about the trash that's on the ground removing responsibility and ethics from the conversation the trash wouldn't be there if somebody had picked it up right and so i do pick it up i pick it up like every time and catherine is like oh my god where where are you going now just across the street to get that half empty malt liquor bottle i'm not doing this because i think that leaving litter on the ground is like equally morally problematic to dropping the litter in the first place but i think that we can all sort of vaguely agree that like dropping some trash on the ground is an amount some amount of disrespectful to the space and if that's the case then picking it back up and not having to be there anymore is like an equal and opposite amount of respectful now litter on the street in my neighborhood is not something that i'm actually that concerned about like not one of the world's biggest problems and pretty much every problem that isn't a bag of doritos in your neighbor's hedge is more difficult to solve than like bending over and bending back up but i find this a useful model when thinking about problems generally because it tells me three things first one person can drop a lot of trash just because there's a lot of trash doesn't mean that all people are dropping trash second bad things are not static they are a result of inflows and outflows and we cannot stop all bad things from happening but we can focus on decreasing the rate of problem formation and on increasing the rate of problem solving and finally it is almost always easier to get mad about something than to do something about it even if the doing of the something is very small and that is an instinct in me that i need to fight against john i'll see you on tuesday i just finished editing this video and discovered that there's a full minute of time that i have which never happens to me but since i have extra time i would like to encourage you to go to youtube.com scishowtangents to watch uh the video version of scishow tangents that we are now doing if you want to subscribe there that would be wonderful tangents is like a comedy game show science podcast that i do with a couple of people uh sari riley and sam schultz where we try to like surprise each other with science facts it's a very good time you can listen to it as a podcast wherever you get podcasts but also now as of this week we're starting to upload it onto youtube since i had extra time i figured i'd let you know about a thing that i'm excited about john again i will see you on tuesday good morning john so i'm doing this apparently let's do a timeline on march 25th elon musk tweeted a poll it said free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe that twitter rigorously adheres to this principle the next day after 70 of the 2 million people who voted in that poll said that they did not quote tweeted that poll saying given that twitter serves as the de facto public town square i will give you a de facto public town square i will not give you the failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy what should be done is a new platform needed not long after that he announced that he had entered into an agreement to buy twitter that was a very loud week and the takes were very hot but there was a concern that i think has borne out that elon musk has kind of viewed twitter from a really particular lens as a guy who was a billionaire with 80 million followers it's not the most typical twitter experience one very well-known effect in the social internet is that in spaces where harassment is allowed to sort of run unchecked a lot of people just leave which is kind of empowering for the harasser because they get to see that their harassment has resulted and the voices of the people they chased away no longer being heard in that space and harassment is always going to affect people with less power more than people with more power that's just how it works so i understand people being concerned by the thought that the man with the most money in the world would be in charge of moderation decisions for a de facto town square elon's answer to this is that he won't be in charge of moderation decisions because all moderation will be based on whether or not something is illegal and after i'm sure hearing a lot of frustration and concern about this he tweeted this the extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all by free speech i simply mean that which matches the law i am against censorship that goes far beyond the law if people want less free speech they will ask government to pass laws to that effect therefore going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people and then there was a period of time of around three weeks when people started to ask elon musk some of the more complicated questions around speech and moderation on the internet and then this week he said this they say something that is illegal or otherwise you're just destructive to the world then then that there should be perhaps a timeout a temporary suspension or that particular tweet uh should be made invisible or or have very limited uh traction if there are tweets that are wrong they should and bad those should be either deleted or made invisible so speech that is illegal or otherwise destructive to the world or wrong or bad this isn't a man who doesn't want twitter to do subjective moderation it's a man who wants twitter's subjective moderation to work the way he wants it to and that is because as a lot of people were saying including me not to brag no one thought who knew about this that we were going to end up with a twitter without subjective moderation like that's just not on the table where do you draw the line that's the whole hard part we were not having an extreme antibody reaction to the idea of free speech we were telling him what it would take him a mere three weeks to figure out for himself which is that twitter without subjective moderation cannot function as of this morning elon musk says that his deal to buy twitter is temporarily on hold as he investigates whether or not twitter's claims about how many of its users our bots are accurate i don't know what this means and and during this sort of initial hubbub about this i wasn't that interested in talking about what elon musk was going to do to twitter because i knew that this wasn't a done deal and also by the way he was talking about it i knew that he hadn't thought really critically yet about how moderation on a many-to-many content platform works but i was really interested in the conversation that it started about how difficult moderation is on these platforms about how yes they have got it wrong in the past and about how maybe the problem isn't that twitter like isn't relentlessly dedicated to the idea of free speech maybe the problem is that we have allowed and invited a private company into the role of de facto town square that is the thing that seems like the problem and it doesn't seem like a problem that gets solved by elon musk buying twitter but it is a problem that gets solved by something cause hey nothing lasts forever jon i'll see you on tuesday good morning john two days ago dan howell uploaded a video called why i quit youtube and the first half of it is one of the most eloquent thoughtful and in my opinion accurate takes on the history of youtube and the many bad parts of being a youtuber and there's not much i can add to it like it's very good i agree with everything in it which is weird because i've talked to dan like twice in my life also it's 85 minutes long and we have a four minute time limit but listening to a summation of some of the worst parts of the last 15 years of my life did make me kind of wonder why why didn't we quit why haven't we burned out on this why didn't we focus on some of the many other things that we had to focus on and just like sorry youtube we're done certainly a lot of other people have done that and i respect that decision a lot like i understand and i can't answer this question for you john cause i think this is very personal i think that different people respond to all of this stuff very differently but i can think back to the times when i did kind of entertain the idea of maybe quitting and it has been because the weight got too heavy for the support that i had to carry and to get an idea here are two of the the forms that that wait has taken first feeling a responsibility that i don't know that i can live up to to be like everyone's unproblematic king like to not only be what i have attempted to say that i am which is already a fairly high standard but also to be what everyone is imagining me to be which is of course impossible because people imagine different things like occasionally i will say something on twitter that is something that i have believed for a long time like since high school and people will be like wow man you've changed and i'll be like yes i have i have but not in that not that thing that thing has been the same so that's hard and one thing i think a lot about is that like people have too many reasons to kind of lose faith in the world right now um and i the last thing i want to be is one of them another form that the weight can take is just having people really dislike me and be mean to me on the internet it's a thing that happens it hasn't happened in a while but it has happened and it's bad so in those moments when it has been bad that has made me feel like why am i doing this i don't have the support necessary to carry this weight and john i think that we have been very lucky in both the weight department like not carrying as much as we might have if we got less lucky or had different lives and in the support department where we just have good support good support which can be both internal and external like i am my own support but i have support around it allows you to not just like handle the weight when it's like sort of piling on but to enjoy it when it's like an appropriate amount because of course some weight is good i want some responsibility i want people to rely on me i want to be held to a standard i want to take what we have regardless of whether we deserve it because what is deserving and do the best things we can with it that is what makes the weight actually feel good and that is i think why this community has done so much different stuff over the years we kind of shoulder it all together and we do good things with it like for example the awesome socks club which has donated over a million dollars to partners in health for our work in sierra leone we have a short sign up window open now if you want to check it out there's a link in the description every week i make a video it could be my last video and i know a hundred percent that everyone watching would be supportive of me stepping away if i felt like i had to i did not upload this video today because i felt like i had to i uploaded this video today because i feel like our work here isn't done and i don't know if i could have articulated that before i watched a dan's video so dan thank you for that after 15 years because of your support and our parents support and our friend support and catherine and sarah's support and the support of all the people we work with at complexly and dftba and you know hopefully by engaging thoughtfully in what we are attempting to do it's not like we don't talk about it a lot we talk about it a lot we've been able to continue creating together and the weight has for the most part remained healthy and the support for the most part has remained strong how i'm feeling after all that is just grateful to have had the luck and the support that we have without which to be certain we would have gotten all these cool things done and we would have quit like that's absolutely true so to everybody who's been a part of this thank you um thank you thank you we're very lucky john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john one of the things that we are asked to do as humans is to understand things that are far outside of our lived experience like i know what a mile is i've walked a mile and i kind of know what a thousand miles is because i've driven a thousand miles what about a million miles we kind of break a little bit outside of our personal experience but luckily humans have had some time to develop tools to deal with this these are important tools to develop i want to share with you five of them the earth is around 25 000 miles in circumference this is luckily almost exactly 40 000 kilometers both of those are easy numbers to remember but are they easy to understand yes kind i can take the thousand miles that i have driven and imagine doing that 25 times that gives me an idea but eventually this strategy breaks when you have to start multiplying numbers that on their own don't make any sense like i don't understand what a million a thousand times is because those are both hard to understand numbers so what do you do with that our minds have difficulties distinguishing between percentages and absolutes going from a hundred to a thousand is the same percentage increase as going from a hundred million to a billion but in absolute terms this is the difference between 900 and 900 million visualizations can be useful for helping understand these absolute differences a stack of a million dollars is a whole lot smaller than a stack of a billion dollars visualizations aren't always easy to find or to create so let's look at another way that doesn't require all that work the classic example here is that a million seconds is around 11 days and a billion seconds is around 32 years i know what 11 days is like and i kind of know what 32 years is like mostly i know that they are very different from each other in the same way the distance from the earth to the moon is around 250 000 miles and from the earth to the sun around 93 million that means nothing to me but if you're going 70 miles an hour you can get to the moon in four years and you can get to the sun and 150. now that still kind of means nothing to me because i've never driven a car for four years or 150 years but i get the scale of the difference but what if i'm less interested in like the relative difference between the numbers and more interested in like the absolute impact of the numbers often if i actually want to understand how big a number is i don't look at the number i look at the number per unit of relevant things often times i just like to divide by the number of people in the u.s like 44 billion dollars is 130 per person in the u.s including all of the babies 44 million dollars with an m is 13 cents per human in america so calculating relative impact gives us some really good data but not as much as our final strategy often times absolute numbers are not particularly useful when it comes to understanding the world if you add up local state and federal spending the government in the us spends around 20 thousand dollars a year per person i actually have a pretty good conception of what twenty thousand dollars is but i don't know what that number means i have no idea if that is the right number i could just go on my gut and say that sounds like a lot or like not enough like i don't know instead we can compare and we can see that the us and the uk and germany and france all spend roughly the same amount per citizen norway which has a bunch of money from oil is about 30 000 india is about 1800 these numbers are just a lot more useful in comparison to each other than they are in absolute terms but if you track government spending per unit of economic production you actually get a very tight correlation bigger economies have bigger state budgets always and there isn't actually that much variation from country to country almost as if a lot of the arguing is about relatively small policy differences and it might actually be better to measure other things like how effective tax policy is at reducing inequality in a specific country well done ireland so experiential extrapolation visualization understandable comparison relevant impact calculation and of course more useful metrics are all excellent strategies that do different things for us on our quest to better understand our world john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john this is my office i've been making videos in here for like eight years i feel like i've never showed anyone around maybe i should do that today the thing about me is that i'm sort of hyperactively focused on whatever current problem i am trying to solve and so i don't take a lot of time to like look back at what i did in the past how i get around that is by putting things on my walls that i will see that remind me of things that that have happened that i have liked for example this is a piece of art by emily grassley that she made for me when she left missoula this is the tour poster for the hank green and the perfect strangers this is the map of the world that titan's great took place in sorry you can't see it very well this is my joko cruise poster signed by a bunch of joko cruise people this is a bowling pin from the time that i bowled a 199 in 2013. if you watched every vlogbrothers video you recognize this and what it is but if you haven't tell me what you think it is here we have a stack of business cards i'm never gonna look at and this is my tote full of conference badges that's uh vidcon london right there this is the x-wing that catherine and i made during the video that at the very end of a very long video we announced that we were having a baby where's the baby i'm a small infestation of these little guys right now this was from the merch table of our tour where we were selling gilbart pins for eight dollars if you understood what that meant thank you thank you for your support i used to think i might do a gaming channel which is why this corner looks like this but it looks cool so i've left it obviously things have not gone great for this guy the head is ah there he is that's curiosity up there next to the air conditioner this is a piece of art from vihart gotta have some star trek the next generation and then maybe giants or i don't feel comfortable now i don't have a gaming channel anymore so i have instead a microscopy station which has brought me a tremendous amount of joy i really can't keep the heads on my bobble head that is a zay frank ducky and if you want to go very very far back into the history of vlogbrothers this is the misprinted business card cube that's some 2007 stuff right there here are a lot of pins that i have collected over the years this is a spur if you want to put on your boot to like jingle around when you walk but actually i got for doing an event at university of texas at austin what is inside the chest though oh we can't talk about that down here is the lizzie bennet diaries dvd set so you can watch it on dvd which i can't do because i don't have a dvd player this month is actually the 10 year anniversary of the first episode of lizzie bennet diary and actually ashley clements who played lizzie bennet is doing a watch through vlog this year so if you want to join here i'm going to be on a few episodes of it you can find it's called look back diaries this down here is my collection of various coins mostly project for awesome but there's also my bim bam one there's a lore one also and here's one of my favorite things that i have let me try and get it out these are a bunch of different kinds of crash course coins so like different looks different feels as we were planning out the first crash course coin of what what was what is possible what we could do like obviously this doesn't make sense but this is just a bunch of different things that they could have done for that coin um and we also things that we could do for future coins i love these very much i honestly think it's because in my head these coins have a lot of value like they are the thing that keeps crash course going people who buy these so having like exclusive versions of them like really gets my collector sense going even though no one knew that they existed until now but nobody can have them they're mine up there that tie is a tie that mr rogers wore not actually one that he wore but he wore that that plaid which our dad bought for me you probably got one too john he's a good dad and then of course we got the meat furby and up there's the bean furby very good pizza john thank you to this person and of course we still have and we'll always have the map of the realm of narnia behind me that's the kurt's gazette calendar this is my first ever badge to a vidcon so that's what it looks like in here this is the place where i spend a lot of my time i hope that was somewhat enjoyable for you i know it was for me john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john panics are not that unusual but they do seem to be all stacking up on each other this is partially the fault of the world like there are some really real problems out there i think that this is more than just like a normal reaction to an imperfect world seem to be finding it easy to get angry and scared on a surface level but hard to get engaged in deeper more helpful ways now sometimes this is because of like legitimately awful people who find it useful to manipulate people into being scared so that they can get them to watch their youtube videos or follow them on twitter or vote for them but also it seems like it's just how communication works on the internet right now it is easier to have simple takes it is easier to share them it's easier to make people aware of the definite obvious clear problem than it is of the misty vague and uncertain solutions i think that all of these things add together to get a lot of people stuck in a place that i am now naming it is the sad gap here's how learning about a new problem works at first you might know that a problem exists but you aren't really aware of it you're not worried about but then as you earn more you get exposed to the definite real concrete inexcusable terrible frightening consequences of that problem and often you are also exposed to the people who either create the problem or are preventing it from being solved and usually though not always this is presented in a way that is oversimplified in order to make you more likely to engage with content because if you don't engage with content then the idea doesn't spread and so now you have entered into the sad gap here in the sad gap it seems that there is quite a lot of evil around evil is what is creating the problem evil is what is preventing it from getting solved and from this perspective it is very difficult to imagine how you or anyone else could ever solve this problem so the sad gap is the place where you mix together outrage and hopelessness and that is always a place that is going to be filled with anxiety and depression and panic but this is not the sad place this is the sad gap as you learn more about a topic you find complexity maybe you realize that fossil fuel workers don't imagine themselves as darth vader's supervillains but as the people who made it possible for your house to be warm and your refrigerator cold and maybe you see that the cost of solar power keeps going down and that we have for the first time since the industrial revolution decoupled economic growth from carbon emissions you see people working to solve the problem maybe you even become a person who is solving the problem but you can't believe that a problem is solvable when you're in the sad gap and you certainly can't help solving here's an incomplete list of things that i'm worried about right now and it is i dare say it too long but there's also nothing i'd take off of it and likely quite a lot that should be added but if i keep adding things it's very easy to enter the sad gap on all of them but hard to find the time to move through it to the other side on any of them especially because the people who make content and the people who share content which is all of us are encouraged by our minds and by the structure of an internet that is designed to always keep us from leaving it to only add stuff to the list and never go deeper on anything especially because going deeper is way more work and so we have all been driven into the sad gap on a lot of different topics all at once and i think that's bad it makes us depressed anxious and easy to manipulate and so now i have put you in a weird place potentially into the sad gap sad gap you now know about a new problem and you don't feel like there's any good solutions out there and it would have been easy for me to talk about this in simpler ways and to blame more people particularly i could have placed a lot more blame at the feet of social media platforms than i did i think that would just be an oversimplification that would make us feel like this is being caused by evil rather than by it just being a problem that should be solved all i wanted to do in this video is to outline that this thing exists that it is too easy to get to the place and knowledge where you are sad and angry and too hard to cross the gap over to being engaged and helped and there are not always ways across the sad gap but usually there are but i do not have time to talk about them in this video because i'm up on four minutes here so john i need you to tell me yours and your video when i see you on tuesday good morning john i've been a little bit stuck recently i think i've been stuck because i often don't know what the right thing is to look at like what's the right thing to see i went on vacation to seattle last week it was the first real vacation i've been on in a long time it was the first real vacation oren has ever been on and we did a lot of fun stuff it was very good one of my favorite parts and he liked it a lot too was just watching the ships come into and out of the port oren would shout whenever we saw a new ship coming or going and we'd run to the window and we'd watch the tugs push it where it was going and then we'd watch all of those containers that had who knows what inside of them getting moved around the port and get ready to be shipped inland or had overseas and i can look at these ships and heat them burning 30 gallons of fuel every mile they travel pumping co2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere and i can look at them and love them people working hard to engage in the tremendous collaborative effort of delivering for all i know awesome socks or micro cosmos microscopes i can look at them and think that they are ugly i can look at them and think that they are beautiful i can look at them and think that they are old and outdated i can look at them and think that they are a tremendously recent innovation i don't know what the right way to see these things is i'm not in crisis i just had a lovely vacation i have lots of support but being 41 years old in the year 2022 has not given me the kind of clarity i expected from middle age if anything things have gotten less clear as i have gotten older i used to think that the scars we've left on this planet and on each other were purely the result of malice or evil or at best ignorance but now i look at those scars and i still see the ones made by hate and ignorance but i also see a lot that are just made by living by love by trying by pushing maybe too hard too fast because of hubris or maybe just because of excitement and joy and hope and community and mutual thriving and fun i look around me right now sitting at my desk i see things that have done harm my iced tea bottle the chicken sandwich that i shouldn't have bought the websites that let us share with each other and tear at each other but i'm also surrounded by things that i love like my iced tea and the chicken sandwich that i can't quit and the websites that let us share with each other and tear at each other i'm not saying i don't think awful cynical greedy people exist they do some people carefully cultivate fear like it's a crop for them to harvest on election day we are surrounded by harm and we are surrounded by aid we are surrounded by joy and surrounded by sorrow i guess i do know now that nothing gets done if there is no room for joy i know that nothing gets done if we only see the harm and nothing gets done if we don't see the harm so i don't know which thing to see more i don't know if i'm seeing the right amount of joy or the right amount of harm or the right amount of grief or the right amount of aid but i know that i have to see both and there is a way of doing this where i see one and then the other and then the one and then the other the horror then the beauty then the grief then the joy but that way of doing it doesn't seem to be helping me get anything done so maybe there's a way to look at the world and see both at the same time john i'll see you on tuesday [Music] you good morning john 10 years ago when we first started making crash course i had a pretty specific idea of what kind of help students needed in high school and college they needed better tools for learning and they do and i'm really proud of the work that crash course has done in that space but also during those 10 years the outcomes for your typical high school junior have not been great 84 percent of those kids want to continue their education after high school but only about 66 percent of them will and of the people who go on to college only 60 of those people will actually get a degree and so yes about 40 of americans with student loans are not gonna get a degree my first impulse when hearing this is this is a learning problem we need to teach these kids better and that is part of the problem but arguably the larger part is just understanding how this tremendously complex system works admissions financial aid credit transfer degree paths a huge variety of institutions with a huge variety of systems only 20 of students receive counseling on how best to pay for college only 30 receive counseling on how admissions work and worst of all of course the people for whom this is hardest are the ones who get the least support from their institutions and systems and they're also the ones who on average have the least time and money to deal with if you need more aid and more loans it's much more likely that you have a full-time or part-time job during the period during which you are applying for school you're also much more likely to have unpaid work doing child or elder care and you're less likely to have other people in your life who have gone through and experienced these systems who can give you advice everything from loans to majors to transferring credits from community college class election career counseling financing this is a big messy bureaucracy and anybody who interfaces with it even people inside of it will tell you this they know that it's hard the less you know the more likely you are to end up in a situation where you've boxed yourself into a bad outcome or you may even be being taken advantage of by bad institutions the inability to make an informed decision when it's one of the most important decisions you're ever gonna make is a big reason why so many students end up with loans but no degree and we understood none of this when we were first making crash course so over the last couple of years for you and me and a lot of people who work at complexly we've undergone a bit of a crash course and understanding how higher education actually works in this country and we had a little bit of help with that so i am excited to be telling you that in partnership with arizona state university we are launching a new youtube channel called study hall and also we are launching a new course on crash course it's called crash course how to college a course that takes on all of the options a person in the u.s has to face when considering their future from financial aid to admissions to majors and careers now we already made a series of courses with asu under the name study hall with a specific goal of helping people with the subjects that most interfere with a student's ability to succeed in early college but now we are launching the study hall project as a whole youtube channel starting with a series that i'm extremely excited about it's called fast guides the fast guides are a quick but pretty deep dive into what you're getting yourself into when you're choosing a major what work can you expect what skills do you need what are good alternatives if you want to switch majors from that major and what do graduates in that major end up doing after graduation i am so excited about these two new things i have learned so much about why they are necessary please check out crash course how to college and the study hall youtube channel and send them to everyone you know who might be going to college in the near future including yourself i have seen the tremendous amount of work and thought and care that has gone into these things and i know that when good people work hard together they really can help to solve hard problems so tell everyone you know there are links in the description and also probably right here john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john this week i spent more than a few moments being frustrated that it was not the right time like putting my son to sleep an hour before he thinks it's his bedtime which resulted in of course him sitting in the bed and saying but dad i'm not sleepy which like of course you're not it was frustrating and no one liked it and thus we began our biannual tradition of tweeting together about how we don't like that this thing happens can we please just stop changing the clock and then the us senate was like okay like all of them a hundred percent of the senate democrat and republican and like whatever else we have now they agreed yes this is silly and we don't like it and it makes us all very sleepy and you wouldn't like me when i'm sleeping no this is not the full process of a bill becoming a law but the unanimity does indicate that it might very well be a thing that actually happened but john something amazing happened the moment that 100 of the senate was like yes we agree on this suddenly a lot of people were mad the disagreement that i saw was of two kinds the first and most common was of this sort oh so the senate can do things when they are easy and free but they can't do things when they are contentious and complicated and expensive what a terrible country look i don't want to be mean about this but i'm a little bit sleepy so i'm not making great decisions if the choice was between universal health care and not changing my clocks twice a year i would take universal health care but that's not the choice the choice is should we do this easy and free thing that everyone wants us to do or not and if your response to bipartisan legislation that will make your life better is i have nonetheless found a way to be angry about it i think maybe the problem isn't in the congress it might be in your chair and on to the second thing which i was genuinely shocked by because of course everyone agrees that we should stop changing the clocks but there are two ways you can do it you can stick with standard time or you can stick with daylight time and congress wants to stick with daylight time and there's a bunch of people who want to stick with standard time and i'm like oh my god how have we found a way to argue about this let's just make the change oh my god no but just for clarity the change that the senate just unanimously agreed on is keeping daylight savings time all year round which means later sunrises and later sunset here are two of the reasons people are mad one i don't want my kid waiting at the bus stop in the dark they might get kidnapped or hit by a car and number two it's anti-science because the society for research on biological rhythms said that it would be better for people to have more light in the morning than have more light in the evening i've looked at some of these papers and indeed it seems that there are some very small but detectable differences in the health outcomes of people who live on the far western portions of time zones where sunrises are later and sunsets are later but there's also research showing that when there's later sunsets kids get more exercise there are fewer pedestrian fatalities because people drive around mostly after work rather than before work and also maybe there's an effect on crime but again all three of those things the effects are really small and when you ask people which might also be important they say they would rather have the extra hour of daylight in the evening when they are more likely to you know like use it and thus as with so much in our society whether daylight savings time forever or daylight savings time never is the better solution is unclear and complex and i have decided to do a wildly controversial thing and not care at all about which way we go here's what i'll say and i think that this is important perfect is subjective it's different for every person and so we are not going to get to perfect for everyone we might get the perfect for you but there will be people for whom this will be imperfect but while perfect is subjective in this case for once better is very clear so let's stop the war on the clocks and just do whatever lawmakers will agree on john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john earlier this week i tweeted a question that i thought was interesting do you think we will still be using phones in 200 years and by phones i mean cute little hand computers side note i maintain that we call these things phones because we saw that their implications were so psychologically overwhelming we needed to give them a name that was really familiar being a phone is one of the 500 things this does like calling it a phone is like calling it a flashlight but whatever steve jobs was like iphone so we're stuck with phone it will always be called a phone i think this is a really interesting question because we've had these things for like 15 years so not very long and yet life seems kind of impossible without them like hear the kinds of answers i got to this question number one i sure hope not i hope that i'm not using my phone in x number of years but do you do you really i like this thing i don't just use it because i'm addicted to it it is a shockingly useful rectangle some people thought that we were going to return to a slower more traditional way of life i don't really see that happening personally some thought that in 200 years we'd exist in some kind of metaverse where we wouldn't need any physical objects at all that also seems unlikely to me to me like i don't know some people thought that their functionality would be somehow implanted into our eyeballs or our skin or whatever like i think that that might that's possible but also even with that i think would also be nice to have a sturdy little rectangle around but also a very common response to this question was hank you think humans are going to be around in 200 years implying in a joking way that like arc do you think we can make it through this now i admit to being the more optimistic of the duo here um but i think that both of us john agree that humans are going to exist in 200 years and probably with significantly more advanced technology than we have right now like that's the most likely outcome look i get it we're not done with the pandemic part and yet we are transitioning somehow into the the tremendous geopolitical instability caused by a dictator with a bunch of nukes invading a neighboring country and starting a horrific and unnecessary war part and we get to do that under the cloud of a global climate changing faster than it maybe has ever changed in the history of the planet it doesn't feel good i agree we've got like the cultural upheaval of a communications technology revolution lining up with the physical upheaval caused by an energy revolution that occurred over the last 200 years and yes humans do have the technology necessary and the weapons built to destroy ourselves many times over why i don't know i don't know why why also i get that this is a joke it's just a joke that i hear a lot and i'm starting to like less maybe it's the repetition but mostly it's the sort of like giving into hopelessness vibe that like that's the sort of fun thing to do is just be like ah hopelessness let's just give up everybody i'm not saying that we are actually giving up i don't see anyone actually giving up i'm just saying talking about it makes it seem like giving up might be the cool thing to do when it's definitely not like it's a betrayal of the future it's a betrayal of the past too it's also a betrayal of the present don't give up we are only past saving when we believe that we are past savior i don't see anyone acting that way not even close i see people working hard for themselves and their families in their countries and their planet i see people disagreeing but i don't see them anywhere close to giving up this is a hard moment and obviously different scales of bad for different people and i don't know what to do about it i read commentary from experts i listen to them interviewed on podcasts and what i hear is this is bad we don't know how to fix it and we don't know what the future holds but i do know that 15 years ago we thought this might be a fun when i graduated from college i could not imagine this thing even existing i had an mp3 player that could fit 13 songs on it and now i am having a hard time imagining a future 200 years from now where we don't have them we never know where we're headed times are rarely precedented but no one is acting like they're hopeless and that gives me plenty of hope john i'll see you on tuesday well good morning john i am still recovering in various ways from the project for awesome the last of my physical consequences is that i put a lot of socks on my hand at one point wasn't a big part of the project for awesome there were so many socks and they pushed on my hand so much that i got an ingrown hair on my hand and it hurts i am however still working through my my emotional and psychological consequences one way to do that is with a project for awesome meme review last year i was able to go through pretty much everything that was uh uh sort of created as a part of the project for awesome this year there were over 600 pieces of art and memes i have narrowed that down to 250 of them and there are last year there were three categories this year there are six we've got crank green we've got john purple we've got two the moon we've got other we've got art and there was one other thing otis memes and since this is a meme review we're gonna start off with the just memes here's one we'll never get to three million uh and the nerdfighteria says i took that personally because john was not ready to live up to all of his promises and yet now he must working all my night beans henry green gets born domino's fall 2022 john gets whammed in the stomach i call this icy milk i say in a room in my home this is not my home it looks very nice it looks very far off the ground but they took the time to make sure i was wearing weird socks which is accurate possibly there's an octopus named hank in in the nemo movies uh and in this one i'm it's it's a green one and it's looking at beanie sanford good old beanie sanfurbs came back for for uh some guest appearances but was not the mascot of this year's project for awesome we'll get to that we're gonna need a bigger banana loca because me and brennan lee milligan were trying to figure out how we're gonna stuff different things full of beans more efficiently this is john trying to to figure out the wordle with me and just not being able to hit vivid even though we had the first four letters kitty time is a finger in the project for awesome and there was an armadillo which is not a kitty but the chat was confused darcy is a dog who started a good portion of the project for awesome got a little carrot every time they hit five thousand dollars so that dog was paying close attention to the stream john persuaded the chat against tattoos hank talking about crap i was very excited about crabs this project for awesome there's always beans in the banana loca there's always money in the benin stand you got both there's both of those things happening if i had a nickel for every time hank green said corn dog asked me i'd have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird that happened twice right is it time for me to explain crank green nah let's do it later just look at it and be confused be a good crab the balloon said look at me i look wonderful i look like a crab jeez there's a lot of crab memes in here i guess i do have to explain it i i popped a balloon and it told me to be a crab and it said it said be a crab you have to be good at it part of the challenge was being good at it so i had to ask everybody very earnestly if i was a good crab and they seemed to agree that i was i'm once again asking for give me the crunch now donating to support charities nah donating so darcy gets a carrot i forgot about this moment until i saw this meme but yeah i did shout that once when someone was drawing a cursed furby i was like it's not not cursed enough yet i have to do a good crab i did shout oh my knees i did it a long time my knees hurt at one point during the project for awesome i stuffed a corn dog full of beans and this meme was made which has made me laugh more than anything else it's a normal corn dog it was not normal there were beans in it this was also made as a follow-up just to like add layers a normal corn dog it's a corn dog it was not a corn dog liking to eat their cursed foods tahan yeah so taha built a terrible sandwich and it turned out he kind of liked it i did the same thing i stuffed baked beans into a banana and like it turned out it was pretty good this is a great meme that is specific to the person who created it it's time you learn about money and the importance of please make sound financial decisions we don't vibe check on p foreign think i said this in like the first hour and i was like this is the this is correct at one point i said that i really wanted my forehead to be on wikipedia and somebody made it happen though only temporarily i didn't mean for it to be the one that i had written butt on the balloon made me do it uh is this a meme or is it just a thing that i kept saying because i popped balloons and they had tasks inside of the balloons for me so the balloon made me do a lot of things for clarity the banana loca is a device that is supposed to put filling inside of bananas and i used it to put feelings that shouldn't be in bananas and bananas and also baked beans inside of a corn dog because i because i wanted to and it turned out it was delicious so i was right have you heard the good news very early in the project for awesome i got a little bit obsessed with whether or not foreheads are part of the face it turns out according to all definitions it totally is so i gave up on that one crank is what they call the crab version doing what the balloon says knees holding me back they hurt right now they're not from being crank just from being hank make a normal project for awesome cake or make a terrible crab the terrible crab is what got made thank you chapa for the beautiful terrible crap we'll get to that body frost and baked beans really do go very well together um just like baked beans and bananas i didn't even notice there's a tiny little beanie sand verbs down in there this is just a dinosaur with a space helmet on yelling about how you are awesome and worthy of care and respect this was my desk after the project for awesome and somebody noticed the baked beans with the spoon still in and also confetti that had fallen into it right next to the fugu poison blowfish flavored potato chips from rhett and link and the mythical team i have cleaned up since i actually cleaned up kind of rapidly because i knew that if i didn't do it soon i wouldn't do it at all there is lots of confetti around there's actually some stuck to the light that's above me it is as john said everywhere like i will be finding it for years this is the story of the hour moving away from beanie sanferbs and toward crank green who at least in my portions of the stream was definitely played a starring role and i i we saw less and less of beanie as the show went on john's big moment on the other hand was this where he went for some purple hair dye this was chosen by his children and then some some mustache uh pink dye it comes from a spray paint can so just like it's it's a beautiful thing it's true there's only one way that you can kind of get away with writing blood on your head as a 41 year old so i'm glad that i found the way this is certainly the case for me uh the product for awesome is the flex tape that we all need right now to stop the giant hole in our acrylic water tank deltify which is the website that we use for our like donations crashed immediately when the project for awesome went live so uh this was created by people who during those 15 minutes when we couldn't get in were like i wanted apparently the chat didn't love my commentary when i was shoving beans into the corn dog hole another one yeah i wasn't looking at all i was i was in my own zone it was a lot of work to try and make the banana loco work correctly so you know i was just i just was saying what was happening there was a magical piece of confetti at the beginning of the stream maybe spiderweb maybe sad electricity maybe dave the fish watching over us maybe just a project for awesome america this meme always of course hits you right in the feels uh but wow they found it was that a good crab no i'm told you were the best hank using live stream time charity videos or beanie sand verbs can't you just like do this both at the same time this is the face he was so panicked about it okay i like a picasso do you want a marie condo and ask if it sparks joy or do you just want to go through your house and see what you could sell for charity because that's what john was doing and it worked when donations are sky high like a flying pizza pie it's a torrey at torres our friend from save the children who visits us every project for awesome stream to talk about the work that they are doing and that is the last of our memes actually there was one more [Laughter] john did a blindfolded taste test and uh he was tired he was tired of sardines obviously i mixed the dinosaur ones in there i didn't do a great job of categorizing it it seems like but here's some more dinosaur to the moon destin time project for awesome memes you are a t-rex at the jameson space telescope and no one can take that away from you we've also got i want to send you to the james webb space telescope that dinosaur mask and helmet really did do it it was very iconic and here's just a beautiful piece of art he's very encouraging he's on a backdrop of space i am going to send so many dinosaurs to the moon god bless destin i am once again asking you to send a dinosaur to the james webb space telescope this is what bernie sanders actually wants for the world i receive 500 for charity you receive a completely free dinosaur trip to mars it's a good deal this was super cute there was a proposal and so we have made some loving dinosaurs i don't actually know what this is about i don't know if i missed this moment or if this person just made a beautiful fairy dinosaur more dinosaur on the moon and then this one is amazing because it's all illustrated except for in the dinosaur's mouth you can actually see destiny we're gone to the moon this is a lot in one category and this category is called crank green starting off with this from rachel it's just uh i want to be a crab so now we've got album cover art for the hit single i want to be a crap this is the thing if you told me i was a bad enough crab i would have done it again and so everybody had to struggle with that decision but you were all very kind amazing pelican art i'm having the boba fish and i got a crank green on my pelican nose i'm wearing a beanie sanford shirt everything's perfect about this i want this jacket it's so cool now beanie sanford is watching me on a stage trying to be a crab and i get that and i get that i've got the word butt written on my forehead and i get that i'm saying am i doing a good job but why is there weird blue lightning coming out of my eyes it levels it up for sure but why frank's daily diet in its natural habitat i got that purely fun sweetened diced tea which i forgot that i did talk about in the beginning got chicken in my mouth we were talking about how chicken crabs like chicken and then i got a corn dog um i like this uh just because of how chaotic it is you just slap my eyes with glasses on any crab and it looks like there's crank green oh this big old face i think that this person was uh making this like sort of repeatable nft style art with beans wearing coats and this one is the crab the crab bean wearing a trench coat 473 beans in a trench coat was a an early joke that i can't even really remember the origin of i've lost it this is a cute little one somebody thought half day did this one uh obviously and oh it moves it moves it's legit this is amazing at the energy of it this was a photoshop job that i then used to create a filter so that i could actually hang out with people as crank green on the stream so anything is possible and then art was made based on that so this is like a painting version of that photoshop you got a furby crab why not be a crab you have to do a good job adorable it'll crank green there just like that's exactly what i look like then then this look at his face and then cute ones i mean there's like the hor the kind of horrifying ones with the human mouths and then there's the cute ones and the more cute ones even this one's got a plaid shirt on like i usually do and also you can see this one's got really rock hard abs and then our final piece of crank green art here here it is i get eyes normalized and i also get crab eyes thank you to elisa for that i should mention that if you want to see the creators of all of these you got the digital download bundle all of these will be uh labeled with the people who actually made this art which we were able to do this year because we had them submit it most of these some of these i found on twitter and i they were not in the digital uh nerdfighter art pack but some of them are and that brings us to now that we've done crank green we of course have to do john purple so obviously john with purple hair and a pink mustache surprisingly kind of elegant once he got through the crisis though in this picture he's definitely still in the crisis moment i know john it's not toxic they wouldn't i mean maybe a little bit look at that boy i love that one then he starts getting cool look at this boy maybe he should have a pink mustache and purple hair all the time got very good pizza john style here i would love to see it spray painted on a wall somewhere legally i got purple hair and a pink mustache and i've got a serious message to deliver this is a really cute one you got a vibe and you got a threat i think that jon made some kind of joke that was this but i wasn't there to hear it but regardless the art is beautiful this is princess pizza john from alice the skirt goes very high up but i do love it like the color scheme is great the pink mustache and the purple hair is actually really good that one's great like very very 70s freddy mercury this is a really cute look at him this is my favorite brother i love the idea of this being a batman joker like being a bad guy and like but he looks like that like what is that guy like he's not like john green he's getting business done and and if you give him a quarterly report that he's not happy with you're out look at that man i'm terrified good pizza john oh no here oh that was very small but you see it it's a princess pizza john that's so cute i love it a thousand stars how do you quantify this thank you hannah for this thing same quote again except i'm there now and it says butt on my forehead and john is looking very serious but now he's got his great it's great hair and mustache and then this with you know crank green and john purple together happy 15 years indeed what a marvelous time it has been there's a lot of other there's a good amount of 473 beans in a trench coat there's a good amount of bean crab man more beans in a trench coat crabs love chicken so if if crab was pizza john it would say chicken we've got a pelican with my glasses on got lots of crabs just drew a lot of crabs you got me hans hoffman science goth mothman can i explain it not really decrease world suck you have to do a good job kimmy made a bizarre beast's pin of crank green the bean crab not bean crab just a regular crab but he is surrounded by beans of course we talked a little bit about people getting confused uh and thinking that an armadillo was a cat this is just a lovely armadillo cat me as dr horrible getting ready to see some really dastardly experiments this is my science boy-less show mercury stardust proposed this idea which i think is a great idea that i'm not going to do here's john a hug and chewbacca i missed this part of the stream there was quite a bit of john and chewbacca stuff it's beautiful they are very happy together when brennan and i were doing banana loca stuff we found the banana logo website we found out that there was a banana loca community here's never sneezer scrooge confronting the spirits of sneezes past present and future are saying sneezing is not normal i love that he's got pizza john's face more beans in a trench coat from luisa from luna we're here because we're here pizza john this probably just should have been in the art folder this is from mickey me with butt on my head and a lot of lipstick on i mean i believed johansen to my very core that he was giving me good advice on how to put on lipstick while i was blindfolded he was like my wife says you should always push really hard like why did i think that was the real thing a person would say it turned out well for entertainment value but i cannot believe i just believed it this i love his face he looks very hardcore but he's got confetti on his hat and he's holding up his sign this is kippers he's wearing a purple mask here we are the the green brothers and we're adorable legitimately what a good couple of brothers i'm very happy to be to have this relationship in my life here's the project for awesome miracle uh confetti that was hanging in mid-air uh some kind of glitch in the simulation definitely not a spider web some more beans in a trench go and here is world suck over time and it goes down and it goes up and it goes down but over the long haul we head to a better world thank you to at waffley original and that is the last of the others which means that what we have left all that we have left is the art starting off with this we're here because we're here infinite oroboro's thing also was from waffley original look at that darcy in a dinosaur costume very good very cute chaos during dustin's segment uh we've got dustin's mike was not able to handle his enthusiasm does

verbs asking for your financial support lots of awesome socks hanging out around there this uh is a can of heinz baked bananas because i got very confused at one point i thought that somebody was saying that there were cans of bananas and it was literally like there there was no reality to this i was just confused but it was good for the art because i love this can of heinz baked banana this is is from katherine liu it's a watercolor page of a lot of the things that went down during the project for awesome so you got all the good stuff here you got dinosaurs and love on the moon you got me being a crab you got beans inside of a corn dog you got john purple you got beans and trench coat you got darcy you got crank green thank you for sharing your skill and talent some more uh dinosaurs in love on the moon this is the template for the beans and trench coats um here's one of them this is me crank and then there's there's john purple should i make this my icon on twitter i mean yeah i should this is what it's like to be inside the project for awesome here's more of crank green science bullets show i do need to get a crab shirt the light soaked days are coming i thought this was really pretty the hope is the thing with emily dickinson's forks can i explain that to you quickly no i kind of can't i just have to i just have to move on here is choppa's ridiculous crank green cake this is an actual cake that you could actually eat and it's me as a crab i don't need to talk more about that you understand how amazing that is john and i have done very few like photo shoots together we did one at vidcon where this picture came from that that you may have seen of us on a yellow background and to adapt it to include john purple and crank green you are a good burrito self-care bunny dftba baked beans with some confetti in it don't forget to be ant don't forget to be ant you got more going to the moon you got handkerfish tie-dye art you got darcy being an absolute monarch here you got john green being some kind of monarch as well i don't know where this came from i don't know if this was referencing anything in particular or if they just did it this is a beautiful piece of art of the cake itself this said this is notable and i don't know if this was something that was said on stream or if it's just uh a banana with this is notable underneath it but i liked it a lot we're here because we're here art taha's really bad sandwich i gotta say i would hate this sandwich full screen three million excitement with the dinosaur and the crab and the john john purple all together here's some art that somebody did of i think themselves enjoying the project for awesome over a long uh a long weekend i didn't see this one during the peafory at all so this one came up afterwards and that this pelican with crank green in its mouth was just absolutely extraordinarily charming to me so thank you so much for making that 23 flavors of confetti dr pepper dfdb and this sticker sheet very good i don't get this one i don't know what's going on um from sylvia here i don't know if this is a reference to something but it's really special things that make me laugh in this image one the giraffe's horn is hitting one of the lights because it's so tall two the giraffe is lifting its hand up so it can read its notes with its little backwards knee three there's another giraffe in the audience watching which gives me the vibe of supportive family member and or significant. it's got my guitar and the the open mic host is wearing a pizza drawn shirt five the woman's face as she looks to her friend like what is happening right now that woman is all of us and then maybe six the face of the open mic host who's like i don't know how to get the mic up to your mouth sylvia thank you so much and then we have just because you pelican doesn't mean you pellet should never follow that advice during the project for us but i never will and finally though i absolutely do want to go on forever and ever i'm going to end with a piece of art that it was unexpected to me i did not expect to get what this is which is a poetry collection of things that we said during the project for awesome get your greasy corn dog hands off dictionary.com face industrial complex for the love of god we lose no one at the dinah space program oh no we did lose someone destined to float forever feeling the air leak out and the void rush in this is what the balloon told me to do is what i will say to my wife later tonight that was because i just written butt on my forehead you can read that whole thing if you've got the digital download bundle as well as some several other non-meme creations and all of the art and memes that i didn't have time to show you on john and everyone who participated in the project for awesome no matter how you participated thank you so much for all of your enthusiasm your creations your donations your videos your votes it was really wonderful and exactly what i needed at that moment thank you meme reviews are exempt from the four-minute time limit as established last year and john i will see you on tuesday good morning john so there is a way in which this is you know not maybe the best time to have a charity live stream it's a messy world and we all want to know what's happening what happened what it all means i mean this is i guess this is somewhat every day we feel like this and as always lots of people have opinions and sometimes they're so strong that they present them as facts but here's the situation no one knows what the future holds and i think that that can make it difficult to focus on anything in particular but there are also ways in which this is a really good time to have a live stream john it's been years now since you have started to say to me a thing that is definitely true and then i believe which is that like it's very easy to focus on the the thing that is happening right now while ignoring more long-term crazies and so those long-term things that are really big deals don't feel like big deals because they're always there and so those problems get solved more slowly than otherwise maybe they could but catherine said something else to me this morning that i had never heard while we were walking around our neighborhood talking about how you know i was talking about particularly how powerless i felt in the moment you know a common feeling i think and she said this amazing thing that there aren't really any problems that aren't connected to the other problems so when you're working on something you're kind of working on everything especially because like ultimately there is one thing that we're all trying to do like there's one big thing it's to make the world better so as long as the thing you're working on makes the world better you are doing the thing that we're trying to do which is to make the world better not perfect better during the first half of the project for awesome we're raising money for partners in health and save the children these are two organizations that have proven themselves be quite good at looking at long-term crises and staying focused on them so that the world can get better partners in health employs over 17 000 doctors operating in 11 countries focused on everything from cancer treatment to preventing malnutrition and save the children has been operating for over a hundred years providing emergency response education programs health programs and advocacy in 2020 they supported nearly 200 million children and helped 12 million children gain access to quality education this is a big world with big problems and these are two organizations that have proven strategies to help make things better and when you go to project for awesome.com donate you can get so many different amazing things in exchange for your donations and all of it is only available during the project for awesome also this is the 15th project for awesome it's also the 15th year of vlogbrothers so a nerdfighter named jim is making a bunch of these laser-cut wall plaques the ones that you will get will say 50 years of vlogbrothers here so i'm looking forward to some donations for these so we can send some of these out to people in my opinion we have one of the best slates of p4a perks ever this year the designs are just really good and make me very happy so many things are challenge coin the socks the poster the stickers a really beautiful deck of cards and for the first time ever the project for awesome puzzle which looks amazing i love puzzles this looks like a fun one we've also of course got lots of digital perks that are all lumped together into the digital download bundle and that this year includes both all of my tick tock drafts over the last year and also all of john's including the ones that john posted for a little while and then immediately took down this is i'm not kidding over 200 total tick tocks if you get both and you do get both if you get the digital download bundle we also have matching donors right now which means that every dollar you donate gets doubled so you can go to project for austin.com donate right now we're also going to have matching donors during the second half of the project for awesome when we're going to be raising money for organizations that are voted on by this community at projectforawesome.com and of course during this whole thing we're going to be having a lovely little live stream here at youtube.com vlogbrothers which you can also find at projectforawesome.com live all of the relevant links are in the description john i'll see you today good morning john i've had a half a cup of coffee and i'm gonna do something i almost never do i'm gonna make an unscripted video about a thing that i care very passionately about you watching this video need to not want a gas stove why because they suck here's the thing that you are right about the curly q heating element stoves they are the worst they're hard to clean they're extremely hard to control like you cannot turn them on and off quickly they take forever to heat up they take forever to cool down what happened is the stove top and natural gas industry made it so that what takes the place of that in your brain is a natural gas stove that has like the little blue flames they're so beautiful that like gordon ramsay uses but what you're doing when you have a natural gas stove is burning stuff in your home which results in get this decreased indoor air quality you can get around this by like having your fume hood like going full blast and certainly never have a natural gas stove that doesn't have a hood or get this you could have an induction stove top that has more power and is easier to control than natural gas chances are there are three pipes connected to your house there's the one that brings you water that one's important the one that takes the water away we also want that and the one that brings you methane what century is this it would be like having the gas station bring the gasoline directly to your car like this is a bad idea i know what you're thinking hank there is no way that cooking my hello fresh is significantly adding to climate change and you're right but here's the thing household natural gas use is a big contributor to climate change it's just not mostly the stovetop however when natural gas companies ask people how they feel about switching their furnace from gas to electric or their water heater from gas to electric they're like i don't care whichever whatever's better i don't know because you currently have a really efficient way to get power into your home that isn't a pipe full of methane it's a power line and there are great electric water heaters and there are great electric furnaces and heat bumps but people say i want my natural gas stove but that's a tiny percentage of the methane that is actually being sold by the gas company almost all of it is used in furnaces and water heaters but as long as people are like i want to keep my gas stove it's harder to clean it makes the air inside my house dirty but house hunters says that it's a top-tier product people will keep having the natural gas companies build and replace this extremely expensive infrastructure to pipe gas into our homes and gas companies are freaking out about this and they're doing all these campaigns about how great gas ranges are even though they are objectively worse because if they can keep that toe hole they can make it make sense to keep giving you gas for those other things that electric could easily replace but look electric could also easily replace your stove because induction stove tops are better than gas and so one of the most important things that you can do as a person who is concerned about climate change is take the little thing out of your brain that says the gas stoves are the best kind of stove and look at it and be like you're a freaking idiot then you throw it onto your induction stovetop and nothing happens because that's not how it works it induces the heat in the pan the stove top itself doesn't get hot cause they're amazing so you have to put it into a pan put that on the stove top fry it up and have it with butter this is why i script that right there is why i script so that doesn't happen it's not important that you replace your gas stove right now in fact it's probably best that you don't it's important that you don't think it's better than induction because it's not because at some point in the future someone's going to knock on your door and say this area is about to have its natural gas pipes replaced and we have to decide whether or not to replace them with infrastructure that will last 60 to 80 years and if a bunch of people in your neighborhood say well i would but i really like my gas stove top it's not gonna happen and we're gonna keep burning methane in people's houses for 80 years i would be sympathetic if gas were better but it's not john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john one of the things that i am very passionate about is the idea that understanding something is a lot more valuable than just knowing that it exists like this kind of got us into a bit of a mess when it comes to pluto for example we taught a whole lot of people that pluto was a planet and now we're teaching a whole lot of other people that pluto isn't a planet but this is confusing even a little upsetting because we gave people a lot of information without any understanding we taught people that pluto was a planet but not why pluto was a planet because when we spotted it we didn't know all of the things there were to know about the solar system and maybe we thought it wasn't that complicated but it turns out it's actually very interesting pluto is a part of the kuiper belt just like ceres is a part of the asteroid belt except we didn't know that the kuiper belt existed until i was 12. that is very interesting but i think sometimes we avoid that story and instead just say pluto isn't a planet like that's the whole story somehow this is like textbook knowing is as important or even more important than understanding and that's just wrong understanding is more important than note but i often forget that this extends way beyond just science stuff which is where i spend a lot of my time thinking in fact i remember very explicitly being told what the proper structure for an essay was without ever being exposed to the idea of like why that's a good structure for an essay or even what the purpose of an essay is turns out lots of purposes for essays right now i am basically performing an essay that i wrote earlier today i have just finished the introduction but when i was writing it i didn't think to myself i need to write an introduction i thought i need to hook people in grab their attention so that i can do some work with them that introduction is going to hook you in but it's also going to provide you some context for the work that we're going to do in the body of the essay which we have now entered see making a great video to promote a charity is hard making a great video at all is hard the main thing you need though is to capture and hold people's attention and i did that with a hook that contained two things that people are passionate about education and doing it right and pluto a dwarf planet you need a similar hook when you're making a project for awesome video promoting a charity and then you need this part the body where you're actually getting the work done right now we're getting the work done it doesn't have to be long in fact it's nice if it's not too long because it's not going to be as hooky because you need to be doing work during the body for example in this case i just gave you information on how to write a good project for awesome video and if this were the body of a project for awesome video it would be talking about why the work that the organization does is important why they are good at doing that work and how they do it and look that wasn't that complicated so i'm not going to spend a lot of time on it in fact as i am speaking right now we are transitioning into the conclusion can you feel it happening it's happening right now the conclusion is a lot of restating the case but it can also be some new information like that making a project for awesome video is a way to have some real significant impact now of course not every charity featured in a project for awesome video is going to get a portion of the money that we raise but a lot of them are and that money can have real significant impacts for those organizations and even if it doesn't have that impact that organization might use your project for awesome video to promote the work that they do but you do have to make a good video and that means capturing and holding onto people's attention with some kind of introduction that might be about something completely different like this video is about how to make project for awesome videos but the introduction was about pluto i've had 15 years of practice doing this so i'm not saying that it's easy but it's not magic it's just work and i just have to say i deeply appreciate anyone who takes the time to make a project for awesome video i'm really excited to see what you come up with submissions are open now they close 48 hours before the project for awesome starts on the 25th capture and hold attention however you can make a clear simple case don't overstay your welcome and john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john a lot of people make a fair amount of noise about the number of ideas that emerge from john and hank and complexly in dftba and nerdfighteria this is not untrue we do indeed have a lot of ideas many of them quite good but while there is a website that keeps track of how long it has been since i've started a new thing it's definitely not a website of all the ideas i've had because most of them get shot down by you it's more like you convinced me that the ideas are not good and i do the same with your ideas we have a lot of ideas and we spend a lot of time talking about ideas a lot we do it so much that we have developed a kind of shorthand that might make it like impossible for someone listening to us talking about our ideas to understand what we're even talking about i might have an idea tell you about it and you would say hank like that's a fine idea but it's both a top ten and a walkman so i don't know why we would do that so because i like ideas a lot and i know other people do as well and i hopefully this these frameworks might be useful for someone else let us pull back the curtain and hope that it will be useful let us start with a walkman a lockman is an idea that has two components that make it a bad idea first it is something that is technically difficult and we are not experts in it sometimes we will call something a walkman just because of this condition like it's a good idea but we are not expert enough to pull it off but to be a true walkman it also has to be something that will definitely get done by someone else so if we worked really hard to get the technical expertise or find someone who did we could come in and do this but it wouldn't really increase the speed at which the idea happened because someone else out there is very likely to implement the idea anyway the example in the name here is the walk ban a big idea that happened when we were kids that is a portable tape player shorthand number two you can't scale a person this is what you say when an idea is permanently overly reliant on a single person that makes the idea definitionally long-term unsustainable that doesn't mean it's a bad idea but you have to know this going into it because a person eventually runs out of hours in the day or runs out of years in their life or more hopefully just runs out of the desire to keep doing that thing forever it seems trivial but you would be surprised by how often ideas end up overly reliant on a person and you need to be accounting for that and working around it when we have an idea that is okay but it gets way better when you give all the profit away to charity that's newman's owning it it's newman's owned this just makes ideas better it makes everybody involved more interested in the project because it makes it more interesting it makes it less like the normal thing that businesses do and newman zoning is a way to make a top 10 a good idea and a top ten is any idea that would be successful but wouldn't actually add very much value to the world this is an old one it comes from many years ago when we had a week on vlogbrothers where we just did top 10 lists and all those videos like 10 times better than the average vlogbrothers video but they did not grow the community they were not interesting they didn't really even teach anybody anything they were just lists and this is not an exhaustive list or anything but let us end with emperor of the world ideas these are ideas that would be really good ideas if and the if condition is everyone would just get out of my way and do what i tell them to do and agree with me this actually comes from something that nerdfighteria's resident mathematician daniel biss said to john once so it all ties together emperor of the world ideas aren't even really bad ideas they're just fantasies john has become pretty clear to me why we have been pretty good at having new ideas that aren't pretty good part of it is that we have each other to interrogate each other's ideas and we've gotten pretty good at that the bigger part of it is we have something that we understand fairly well that almost no one else has access to a fairly large group of interested passionate supportive people with really good values those people can provide an amazing activation energy for a new idea but they also provide a constraint the idea has to be within the values of the community this keeps us focused not on top tens but on things that actually provide value and are interesting and new and dynamic and weird and the results have been something that i am extremely proud to have been a part of john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john in 1969 neil diamond dropped what would become an american classic his hit sweet kerala and the only reason that is important to this video is because after he sings the name of the song sweet caroline these horns come in and for some mysterious and complicated reason it has become an american tradition to at that point of the song and then after this line [Music] you go so good so good so good if you are in america and you hear this song in public and there are a lot of people around it is extremely unlikely that you will not hear these improvised editions why am i talking about this well john back in 2017 when you and i went on tour we hatched an extraordinarily precarious plan based on this phenomenon i would play on my guitar sweet caroline and then we would instruct the audience to during the part where you would normally do the ba-ba-ba's to remain perfectly silent this is a treacherous thing this is like riding your mountain bike on the side of a cliff because you have just given everyone in the theater the power to make this not happen and everyone has to agree everyone that it should happen and because we are raised in this society and we expect the ba bapas in that moment the absence is a presence it's like a kind of silence that is louder than any other kind of silence i have ever experienced which is why when it worked it was really wonderful and it did work about 75 percent of the time the other 25 of the time someone would do it now occasionally this was an honest mistake someone had been buying their whole life it was hard to not bop up ah they accidentally bopped out or just which was adorable like those in those cases we tried again and if it worked it worked but in some cases somebody was like and then we tried again and they did it again in that case you just stopped doing it and the first time that happened john i remember us having a conversation backstage like maybe we shouldn't do that bit anymore because when it didn't work it felt pretty bad we decided to keep doing it in part because it felt so good when it worked but also because i think of how instructive it is when it doesn't work because there's a bunch of lessons you can take from this the first and easiest lesson to take is that look we're humans and if you give everyone the power to ruin something someone will and that's kind of a bummer but ultimately it's true you can't get around it but here's another lesson that it took me a long time of thinking about this to get to in the situations where there were 500 people in the room who didn't go ba-ba-ba the people in the room had a dramatically different experience than the people in the rooms where 499 people didn't go ba just totally different sets of learnings from those two experiences the people who only had it one or the other way which is everybody except for me and john just had such different moments but in both of those situations mathematically the experiences were basically identical either 500 people not making any noise or 499 people not making any noise that's the same right but it is interpreted entirely differently regardless of the fact that like mathematically every one of those rooms had functionally the same experience they did not walk away with their brains thinking the same thing it's just impossible to feel like 500 people stayed silent when only 499 did but that's not evidence that 499 people didn't do something together they did it's evidence that my brain can't interpret reality correctly but i don't think those two lessons are the only ones you can take from this so i'd be curious to hear other people's takes as well in the comments john i'll see you soon so good good morning john yesterday i was part of the unveiling ceremony of the 75th annual doomsday clock this is basically a subjective measure of how close to doom we are super fun you've probably noticed that there's been a lot of bad piling up over the last three years pandemics and climate change and rising isolationism and fascism feels reflecting that the clock has been set at 100 seconds to midnight for the last three years which is as close to midnight as it has ever been in those 75 years as the kids say big yike i is it the kids that say that when they asked me if i would be interested in giving some remarks i was like only if i can be hopeful about it and they're like of course that's yes yes we want that then i looked at a couple of the previous years and some of what was being said about this year i was like honestly this seems quite bad so then i sat down to what was a challenging writing assignment i was going to be going last after a bunch of people sort of like went over why things are particularly bad right now and in many ways worse than they have been for a long time and then say something hopeful and like ideally empower it and i want to talk about how i took that challenge on uh just as sort of a writing assignment i started out by saying that just because you might be staying in the same place doesn't mean you're not active it doesn't mean you're staggered which means that we can talk both about the good news and the bad news and there is plenty of both so that was my transition out of what i knew would be sort of bad news coming from the person before me then i zoom way out we think far more about what happened this morning than we do about what happened four billion years ago even though that thing that happened four billion years ago is a bigger deal and a bunch of water and energy and carbon was like hey i'm gonna be a lie and then depending on how you count and also reality that we haven't uncovered yet somewhere between a few million and a few hundred thousand years ago the universe started to talk to itself about itself it started to be like wow that's pretty and that's us like that's this like this is the universe talking to itself yeah so let's keep an eye on that because there's a reason why we're so worried it's because this is really wonderful so we're protecting something great so that's good a little bit of perspective you don't usually hear when you're talking about multilateral arms treaties but my most important trick here and something that i think we would all benefit a great deal from is talking about the fact that things are hard for reasons like you right now are in the middle of the largest communications revolution in the history of the human race so like yeah we're gonna be bad at it doesn't mean we should resign ourselves to being bad at it doesn't mean we can't be better but like it's not surprising that we're having a hard time i'm getting legitimately worried by the number of people who seem to think we could solve these problems if only humans weren't so awful and stupid and bad i think that idea is seductive i think that it is tremendously disempowering and i think that it is objectively wrong humans do things that were once impossible constantly like the this that we're doing right now was once impossible and in the future we will do many things that are currently impossible i think that getting stuck in disempowerment is the worst place to be for challenging institutions and solving hard problems rage without an outlet is only ever going to make things worse so my remarks i decided to offer an alternative to this once in a while instead of getting mad get curious start with a person or an institution that deeply discusses a big problem that might be the prison policy initiative for incarceration david roberts's volts newsletter and podcast for climate change or fair fight and stacey abrams for voting rights spend some time engaging with those problems on a deeper and deeper and deeper level and even listen to people who disagree with you about those things so you can understand not the most awful radical terrible version of those arguments but the arguments that they're making that are actually convincing people you will realize that these big heart problems are made up of thousands of smaller problems and that each one of those smaller problems has a bunch of people working on them and if each of us is focused on one of those problems we're going to be way more effective than if all of us are focused on all of them and thus not engaging deeply on any of them and that is how i hope i wrote a talk about doomsday that wasn't depressing jon you can see those remarks at a link in the description i will see you on tuesday good morning john so next week a particularly unhinged episode of dear hank and john is going to go up we're just a total mess because we accidentally talked for 90 minutes before the podcast started so we didn't have enough time to record the podcast and i think that the first question that was asked was from avery who asked i was wondering how or if we know that the earth is straight up and down with the northern hemisphere on top of the southern hemisphere on the bottom which led to much hilarity but to continue a discussion that you have not heard yet because the podcast is an hour i want to talk about a time when we humans got something right now every there is no uh it's all arbitrary it's just stuff that we sort of feel and decide for example i live in a river valley where three rivers come together and if you're gonna go into the bedroom valley and you're from missoula you can actually tell something about a person by what they say if they are new to town and don't have a lot of relationship with the land they say that they're going to go down the bitter room whereas if they've been around for a while or they have a deeper connection to the land they say they're going to go up the bitter room this is because when you're going from missoula to the bitterroot valley you are going south but you are also going upstream and uphill the bitterroot river unlike most rivers in america though this is just by coincidence flows from south to north and weirdly this feels a little weird to us even though there's no reason why a river should go in any particular direction like the nile also goes from south to north this confusion implicates as faulty the entire idea of south as down and of course south is very very much not down globes and maps only show north as on top because someone decided that who i don't know but i want to make the very strong case that if they had to choose and i think they did they made get this the right decision things are a mess in this world and we understandably focus a lot on the things that we got wrong for example like that there are 12 months in a year this is terrible if there were 13 months instead of 12 every month would be get this 28 days long except for one which would be 27 days long and 28 days divided by 7 is four so every month would have exactly four weeks in it every month would start on a monday and end on a sunday every holiday would happen on the same day every year and then at the end of the year we'd have one month that was one day short we'd have one week that was one day short and we'd all be like oh this is the cute fun week where we all act weird because there's only six days this is a historical screw-up that we all have to live with forever but maps in the past often would have either west or east at the top and if we had ended up in the universe where we got stuck with this it would have been historically bad because we spin so the actual like location of where west is moves around in space i can even get my head around how hard it would be to conceive of how the earth is if i imagined that west was up like it just breaks me so we absolutely dodged a cosmic bullet here now if it had ended up with south on the top this would not have broken my brain but it would have been a sub-par choice to having north on the top because the southern hemisphere is 80 ocean while the northern hemisphere is just 60 percent ocean so there's twice as much land in the northern hemisphere also 90 percent of the people live in the northern hemisphere now what i'm not saying is that this has no drawbacks there are negative consequences to having settled on north as up on maps for example no one knows whether or not to say up or down the bitter room more importantly we show some unconscious bias toward things in the southern hemisphere and when researchers test people they unconsciously assign more value to places that are further north but also there is huge value in having some kind of standardization here where we all agree that one part of the map is always up and so we don't have to be thinking about it and getting it wrong there were pros and cons to this choice it had negative effects but we made the right call and we ended up avoiding a problem that we never have to think about whereas i always have to think about the fact that we could have lived in a world where halloween was always on a friday night every year john i'll see you on tuesday which is some random day of the month Good morning John, yes you got to record the 15th anniversary video of vlogbrothers but I, and this is a weird coincidence, one day later get to record the 2,000th vlogbrothers video on this channel. And I woke up yesterday to a massive dump of snow which meant that Orin’s school was canceled  So all of my normal plans went right out the window. So what do you get? You get our 2000th video. A compilation of clips I recorded of me talking over it, because I’m gonna be honest, it’s one of the faster ways to make a video. I started out the day making Orin a bagel and then shoveling the walk even though I knew dang well that it wasn’t gonna stop snowing for another 12 hours. Then it was time for Katherine to take over shoveling and I went upstairs to write a couple of really important emails and oh my god is that really what I look like? Then Katherine came in for some recovery time and then it was time for a full hour of Junk Yard Joust, a game where you put hot wheels down a track and they get eliminated if they land on their back of their side. Go ahead and pick which team you think will win. 3 of them will, because Orin doesn’t like it when only one team wins. I put the names of the teams in a pinned comment below. You can reply with the team that you like. This is currently Orin’s #1 favorite way to spend time, cars that get eliminated go in this box. He has a bunch of very specific rules. And then of course we had to watch some actual Junkyard Joust on Youtube. Which is an amazing Youtube channel if you haven’t seen it. It is so fun. And then after that he was sad that we weren’t going to watch any more Youtube videos so he decided to have a  rest underneath this pillow.  I then went for a walk to the coffee shop to get Katherine a latte and listen to the climax of Jade Legacy which is a really amazing book. And yes I did cry while walking down the street. Also on the way I helped push a truck out of the snow. I love a snowy walk. I love a snowy town. I love it when everything slows down a little bit and everyone has to take care of their stuff and take care of each other. I especially love when there is a decaf americano and a croissant at the end of it. Then I had to start writing this script. This is a video of me writing the words I am saying right now, also not tremendously flattering. And then, time for more shoveling. This time I did my neighbor’s walk because he’s out of town and then I had to tweet about how, because of a scheduling mistake we had to push the date of the Project for Awesome back to February 25th which I know is very inconvenient for some people. I’m sorry about this.  We tried to find some other way to fix it but we failed. But yes I am very excited for the Project for Awesome, February 25th. Everybody get ready. I also just uploaded the amazing recap video that Maia edited, and it’s on Hankschannel and you can watch it and remember all the fun times that we had. Then I wrote some more emails and I wrote a tweet about how my pants were wet because of the truck that sprayed snow all over me. Then I recorded a secret video for somebody else that I can’t tell you about right now. And I also wrote a bunch of other stuff that I also can’t really tell you about right now. And look, one of the really fantastic things about vlogbrothers is that we often come to an important point at the end of the video. But often times, we don’t. Sometimes life is just about life. It’s about doing all the things you wanted to do that day, or you needed to do that day. Sometimes it’s about 2,000 videos of content, 15 years of life doing things that I couldn’t imagine because they didn’t exist. And always, always, because a bunch of people working together to keep each other honest and push for really interesting and useful stuff to exist in the world. That stuff existed! And the amazing thing is, I have no idea if I’m halfway through this. Have I made most of the videos I will ever make? I don’t know. Probably. 1,000 videos is a lot of videos. But I don’t know. I’m not looking too hard at it. Because I certainly could not have guessed how the last 15 years would go. What an amazing run! So weird! So much fun! And so many amazing things that would not have been possible without this community or the people who work at Complexly and at Vidcon and at DFTBA. And finally, the moment you have been waiting for: here are your Junkyard Joust winners. Congratulations to the white team, the green team, and the batmobiles. John, thank you and I will see you on Tuesday. good morning john now i would not normally release a video on christmas eve but a bunch of people who have been working for decades one of the most exciting scientific instruments ever built are going to be releasing that into space on christmas day so i could not help myself i made a video about the james webb space telescope and how amazing it is going to be on this channel 10 years ago and now it is headed to space this is an endeavor to help answer real deep human questions some of the biggest ones like how do planets form is there life elsewhere in the universe and how does the universe work you can't do what the jwst wants to do from the ground and to understand why you have to remember that light is made up of lots of different frequencies we can only see with our eyes a really narrow band of those frequencies but the web wants to see specifically in infrared for several different reasons the big one being that the universe is expanding and so things that happened a long time ago and are very far away their light has actually been stretched by the expansion of the universe and it's been stretched into the infrared but there's a problem with this which is that infrared radiation comes off of anything that has heat and basically everything has heat but the exceptional reality of the web is that at the tiny dim levels of light they want to measure from exoplanets or the beginning of the universe if the telescope itself is warm at all the mirrors will radiate infrared light that would overwhelm the observations so the telescope has to be extremely cold so you need to block out all sources of heat particularly the sun but also the earth and the moon which shoot off enough infrared radiation to heat up the telescope too much so the telescope has to have a heat shield that can block off of that heat but it needs all of those sources of heat to be in the same direction so the heat shield can block all of them at the same time luckily there is a gravitationally stable point on the opposite side of the sun earth system and that is where the web will orbit keeping its solar panels and sunshield pointed toward the earth and the sun while on the other side the telescope thanks to its five giant heat shields will be cold enough to liquefy air the launch and deployment of the jwst is going to be extremely tense it's scheduled right now for christmas morning 7 20 eastern time and that launch is gonna be tense but it will not be the end of the tension so just so you know what we're in for in the path to making these tremendously valuable observations here are the biggest size of relief that we are going to experience over the next month the first one will come about 33 minutes after launch when these solar panels will automatically deploy because that means we are in space and the craft can power itself 12 hours after launch we have the first burn now remember the web cannot be refueled it has all the propellant it will ever have so depending on how accurate the initial launch was this course correction could use more or less fuel and using less could potentially add years to the mission so another big reason to worry right here three days after launch you start the five day long process that is to me the scariest the deployment of the sun shield each of these tennis court sized sheets are thinner than a human hair everything has to go right it has been tested and it all should the temperature difference between one side of these sheets and the other side is 600 degrees fahrenheit and finally the biggest weight comes off of everyone's chest 13 days after launch when the mirrors and some other important bits of the telescope have been fully deployed and it will be ready to be a telescope and the final sigh of relief happens 29 days after launch when the telescope will be at a stable orbit at l2 at which point the web will have been successfully deployed and the team will spend a further four to five months calibrating and testing the telescope before five to six months after launch we received the first ever images from the james webb space telescope john i don't know what the point of being a human is but i know that somewhere close to the root is curiosity we want to make the world better for ourselves and for other people but even without that concern i think we want to know we want to learn we want to look really deep into ourselves into our world and into our universe and in a very literal way we are about to see deeper than we ever have before the jwst launch is scheduled for christmas morning 7 20 am eastern time john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i've been a person who professionally talks about science for years now it's a wonderful job and i love almost every question i get there are two kinds of questions that i don't love to get one is one that i've answered a bunch of times before and i'm like all right somebody else handle this one second is questions that seem like they should just be very easy to answer but they aren't and they're just they sit there and i don't answer them and i'm like why is this so hard and no question in this second category is more common than the title of this video what state of matter is fire if you ask this question to google you get all wrong answers why are we doing this to ourselves what is so hard here well we are doing this to ourselves because it is very very very not simple now matter really does mostly exist in a few discrete states and that's literally because of how the atoms and molecules are interacting with each other but i think what mostly sticks with us uh isn't like thinking about in terms of particles it's just sort of the the qualities so a solid keeps its shape a liquid keeps its volume but its shape can change and then a gas its volume and shape can change and if you just take that and you put it on fire you're like well none of that's true so let me instead answer this question with a question what state of matter is a waterfall now you're going to think to yourself hank that's a liquid but no the water in the water follows a liquid but the waterfall is not matter it is a process caused by a bunch of liquid and gas and solids in a specific situation a waterfall does not have a state of matter because a waterfall isn't matter it's a process now you can look at it and you can say that cliff is made of rock and the water is a liquid and the air that's sort of tossing up those beautiful water droplets that's a gas so i can kind of answer the question what state of matter is a waterfall it's a bunch of different states of matter and so the natural thing to do is to do this with fire just label the constituents and this is why fire is harder than a waterfall because the molecules in a fire unlike the molecules in a waterfall are undergoing rapid chemical reactions and while those chemicals are still made of matter they are reacting they do not have a state of matter because their electrons are jumping from atom to atom molecules are rearranging and in the space between one chemical and another we don't really know what things are because we can't put them in bottles we can however stop them i'm gonna do that for you right now i'm gonna i'm gonna pause the chemical reaction while it is going off if i pass my spoon through my fire what i get is soot and this is why a lot of people say that the state of matter of fire is a solid what is happening in this fire is that wax is evaporating and then it is combusting it's burning in the process of that combustion lots of different weird chemicals are formed and they are all turned into these little tiny particles that in the flame while they are undergoing chemical reactions glow with their own heat as they continue through the flame they continue to react and at the end of this process you don't have that solid anymore but in there most of what you see as the fire is solid pieces of soot glowing but there's also a component of the flame the blue part to be exact that is not caused by soot particles glowing this is excited atoms of gas emitting light as well but also because there's so many reactions happening so quickly in combustion a lot of the matter in a flame isn't behaving like how we think matter behaves because it's in the midst of a chemical reaction so those atoms and electrons and ions and molecules and in-betweeny molecules they kind of aren't any state of matter and maybe we will understand all of that better someday but really it's just a place where these usually quite hard lines between things kind of breaks down for me though there's a real answer here that's all much simpler than this fire does not have a state of matter because fire is not matter fire is a process john i'll see you on wednesday to wednesday tuesday by the way this used project for awesome calendar is now available we do it a little before the project for awesome so you can actually have it this year's calendar celebrates a lot of the history of nerdfighteria with different images from kind of different eras of this wonderful bizarre thing that also is very difficult to describe good morning john one of the weird things about being on tick tock is that because the group of people there is literally just different people oftentimes younger people there are sometimes conversations i see being had that i have had like pretty much everybody i know is done with that conversation but they haven't had it yet so they're having to have it this happened recently when i saw a tick tock uh arguing whether to say jiff or gif and and i am at least five years into having heard everything you can say about that and having settled upon both are correct so i did actually get a little bit pissed off when i heard again the well it's not giraffix interchange format it's graphics interchange format so it must be gif that's not how acronyms work i don't care how you pronounce gif but i do care if your argument is garbage but this is not the point that i want to make my point is that there are some things that definitely don't matter we know they don't matter but they're jarring when we come across people doing them differently like when i see a screenshot of light mode twitter i'm like what what are you thinking smiley face without noses i don't like it other people don't like me doing smiley faces with noses cowboy bebop subtitled versus dubbed at england now look i'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons why these things are different like the experience of subtitled cowboy bebop is different from the experience of english dub gif makes sense because if you put a t on it it's gif jif makes sense because that's what the developer of the format called it taking the toilet paper off the front makes it a little bit easier to take off having it on the back makes it so that your cat can't like do this and just have it all come on i'm not saying there aren't differences here what i'm saying is that the way that i do it is the way that i think everybody should do it and i'm gonna come up with reasons why that's better people can argue all day about whether subtitled or dubbed cowboy bebop is better but the one that they like is the one that they watched first light mode twitter looks normal if that's what you're used to using dark mode looks normal if that's what you're used to using the thing that's bugging us it's not all these rationalizations it's just the fact that it's different and i'm not saying that we're bad because we're irrational i'm just saying that we're irrational and the fact that things this simple that do not affect our lives at all can make our brains go oh no something is wrong i don't like it i think it shows like how hard it is to do society how are we as a species supposed to get anything done when things that don't even matter cause these little mini protests in our brains i can't watch english dubbed cowboy bebop even though i know that it is very good and that many people make the case that it is objectively better than the original version i can't do it it's like fingernails on a chalkboard it's like i know that i'm being and i know that i'm being irrational i don't want you to think that like this is me being a hipster no i know that it's stupid and i will never say gif i will never say gif i just won't when i think about it this way it is absolutely amazing that we get anything done at all things that actually matter are so hard just on their own but then you've got like also to include all these little irrational biases that we have and are going to have and can't get rid of we are really deeply controlled by wanting things to be the way that we expect them to be whether that is like how the economy works or whether a smiley has a nose but that stuff is never going to be universal because the world is complicated and varied and weird and it should be weird i like it because it's weird here's a definitely true thing no two people have ever agreed on everything ever and yet we have managed to get quite a lot done which gives me hope that in the future despite all of this we will continue to get stuff done john i'll see you on tuesday john it's the next day and it's the first time in ages that i have ended a vlogbrothers video and had time like this is shocking i don't know what to do i guess what i'll do is to remind everybody to go watch your video from last week which was really lovely and thoughtful and beautiful and i was very touched by it thank and and i'm gonna thank everybody for joining the awesome socks club look if you're a current member you get these cool froggy ones but if you just joined your first sock will come in january good morning john is how we start these videos you don't like throw that in a couple of sentences into the video and expect to not hear about it anyway there's a pretty big problem that i think i have come up with a good solution to you know how when you put your foot inside of a shoe it doesn't feel great it can be like bumpy in there and a little rough and like the foot sweat builds up i have invented a product that goes between your foot and your shoe it's like a kind of foot sleeve it's stretchy in cotton and you pull it up on over your foot before you put your shoe on and then boom it cushions your foot it absorbs the foot sweat and you can even wear them without shoes just to keep your feet warm around the house now this is a really new idea but i think there's a chance that it could really catch on which brings up something that i've been wanting to talk about for a while when you or i have an idea like something that we would like to bring into the world we're not entirely in control of what that idea needs to look like no individual humans are in charge what is in charge is a set of values and expectations that this community shares when appealing ideas mesh with those values amazing things can and have happened and that's a really big part of like what we do here because i think that foot sleeves could be a really big deal but you can't just do foot sleeves the normal way if it's going to be a project from this community you have to do it in some way that is exceptional and finds ways to be in concert with the values let's say for example that it's a subscription where you can sign up and get foot sleeves in your mail every month each one designed by a different independent artist and also instead of being open all the time with all of the inventory problems and excess waste that that can create it's only open during very limited windows and also because this community is much more interested in solving long-term problems than it is in short-term profit you donate all of the profit to help build more robust healthcare systems and impoverished communities so now it is time for me to abandon the conceit that i uh invented socks especially because this will be the second year of the awesome socks globby sock subscription for charity that this community has helped energize and activate with its values and its goals and its mission so much so that it has allowed it to grow outside of this community and we project that we're going to donate over 900 000 to charity this year and also because the yearly opening of the sock club starts today and it goes only for the next nine days if you click on the link in the description you can sign up to get a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist delivered to you every month shipping is free and you can cancel any time and yes every dollar of profit goes to support our community's work decreasing maternal and child mortality in sierra leone there is one thing that has changed in our second year last year we set it up as a one-year subscription six months in we discovered that the majority of people thought that it was a perpetual subscription so if you are an early adopter to the sock club you will need to renew if you want to keep getting your socks uh starting on january of 2022. to do that just go into your email and search for an email that i sent you just search hank green in your inbox if you don't have that email you don't need to do anything moving forward the awesome socks club is perpetual but you can still cancel any time just to avoid that confusion but you can also get a gift subscription if you want a subscription that will automatically cancel after 12 months imagine how revolutionary an idea socks would be if they had not been invented yet we would be so excited about that but this community did not invent socks what it did do is with its values and with its activation and excitement it invented like a new way to do socks instead of the way where you have to think too much about it and stand around awkwardly in the target underwear section and then it being not that cool looking anyway and all the profit goes to some stranger you let the experts take care of it with a delightful surprise delivered to you once a month and 100 compostable packaging and yes all of the profit goes to make the world a better place just out here solving problems the nerdfighter way there's a link in the description john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john in the year 2000 juan and pedro sanchez two brothers in mexico were drilling down in a mine that like a lead in silver mine it was hot down there like 130 degrees fahrenheit it was i imagine unpleasant and dangerous work and mines are always contending with a lot of different hazards one of them though is water because mines are underground and water goes down people and equipment both work best when they are not submerged in 130 degree water so mines almost always have huge pumps that remove a tremendous amount of water from the ground so that people and machines can work down there well in this mine in mexico something magnificent had been uncovered by those pumps with that water taken out those brothers drilled down into a giant cave full of some of the largest crystals ever discovered on earth now an important thing to know you cannot go visit these crystals one because the mine has since stopped pumping the water out and so that cavern is now full of water again but maybe more importantly the scientists who did get a chance to go down into this cave they had to wear some very special suits and those suits were designed to do two things one keep them cool because not only is it 130 degrees fahrenheit that's 55 celsius it was also extremely humid because like there's a lot of water down there and all that water was evaporating into that very hot air and so it was like 90 to 99 humidity in there which meant that the water that you sweat can't evaporate from your skin into the air there's no room left in the air for more water so you have no system for cooling yourself off and you would overheat and die and more terrifyingly they also had to wear basically scuba equipment they had to breathe air that they carried around with them but why because the air down there isn't poisonous there's not like some weird alien spores that are going to infect their lungs it turns out that 130 degree air can hold a lot of water right so 100 humidity with 130 degree air that's a lot of water in the air and when you bring the temperature of air down it can hold less water so that water condenses out that's why lots of water vapor going up into the atmosphere condenses into clouds when it reaches higher colder areas of the atmosphere yes that's where clouds come from also why a glass a cold iced tea has water conducting on the side of it because the the air hits the side of that glass cools down and the water falls out when it's 130 degrees and 100 humidity outside you know what's cooler than the air the inside of your lungs so if you didn't have a tank of air on your back every breath you would take in this cave would condense a little bit more water in your lungs a little more a little more until you drown now this did not happen to anyone they knew that it was a thing and so they were able to plan around it but still that's why this is a really really really cool planet but in a sense like we kind of never should have seen that cave and now that the mine is no longer pumping the water out we can't see it anymore it's just down there and we had this very narrow slice of like five years during which we could examine and study these giant crystals we only got to see those crystals because of a truly bizarre series of coincidences this reminds me of how in rome they've spent 40 years trying to build a single subway line but every time they dig they find some other like truly irreplaceable remarkable archaeological site there's just so much that remains hidden from us i told katherine about these crystal caves and she like exclaimed on our walk home the earth is an alien planet which is just such a good line because of course like there is nothing less alien than the planet that we evolved to exist on that we as a species have barely ever left that sustains us every day but also it is right even after all of this inquiry it remains full of the unknown and it's so inhospitable to us in everywhere except the very narrow slice just at the surface and yet as we continue to prove over and over again these unknowns are knowable and i know that this doesn't make any like philosophical sense but making those unknowns known whether they are about avocados and megafauna or giant crystal caves it just seems like a very good use of time john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john about 12 000 years ago some people started to get really good at controlling the plants that made their food they would take care of them they'd move them around and water them and remove their competition and they started to plant seeds from the plants that were just a little bit better they were a little easier to take care of they made some more food they tasted a little bit better that kind of thing choosing something that was a little bit better and then a little bit better than a little bit better it made things a lot better over the long term this is one of my favorite examples uh that's just the tip of some grass that you're looking at right now and that we selected into this giant hunk and crunch of sweetness this is usually called artificial selection but i think that might be a term that we eventually move past because like we're not fake we're just human but also because the term artificial selection makes a little less sense when you notice that there are cases of unintentional evolution through human selection let's talk about it one of the ways we take care of crops is we eliminate their competition we pull up weeds but you can't ever pull up all of the weeds and you are least likely to pull up the weeds that look a little bit like your crop because you don't want to pull up your crop and so the weeds that looked the most like their crops were most likely to get left and then their offspring would look more like the crop and the ones that looked the most like the crop would be most likely to procreate you see where we're going here eventually you end up with a weed that looks almost entirely like your crop plants that do this are called vavalovian mimics named after the guy who first figured this all out and valvolovian mimics remain to this day a problem as an example camelina sativa is a plant that is also sometimes called false flax kind of impractical to separate them out in the field so we ended up separating out the seeds making sure we only planted flaxseed in the field we created big machines and a lot of infrastructure to do this and you know what happened we created a new evolutionary pressure to have false flax seeds look and act to that machine exactly like flax seed so now the machines can't tell false flax seeds from flax seeds what a gigantic pain in the butt john i sometimes worry that we look at our world and we only see the problems it makes sense that we would do this if you're a flax farmer you have to think about false flax a lot but false flax is a problem that was created by a solution that solution being agriculture and agriculture safe to say has created a lot of problems but it's also solved a lot of problems including probably the biggest problem an individual human can have which is the i don't want to watch my child starve problem solving problems creates new problems like the last hundred years of remarkable increases in quality of life and increases in the value we place on human lives would not have been possible without coal and oil and gas and those fuels created a huge number of problems some of which we solved some of which are going to require us to stop using them in order to solve global warming is not a problem that was created by evil it's a problem that was created by people solving problems i was listening to the ezra klein show a couple weeks ago and maggie nelson said uh something that i don't know if i've ever heard a more true thing said more beautifully she said that people right now have a deep hunger for a tool with no blood on it and i do i do but i don't know that that exists i don't know that it can exist the world is messy and we need to stop thinking that we can survive in it without doing any harm we need to find ways to mitigate the harm and ways to solve the problems we also need to understand that the solutions to those problems will create yet more problems the internet is an amazing solution that has created a lot of problems i wanted it to be a tool with no blood on it it is not but the human experiment that we are all a part of is not an attempt to arrive at perfect it has always been and will always be an attempt to select for a world that is just a little bit better than it was before john i'll see you on tuesday p.s john cause i know you weren't gonna let me get away with this my cat's name is gummy bear which is the decision that oren made and it's a cute name because it's like cute and bouncy but also secretly i like it because a good nickname for a cat named gummy bear remains goburker which i do still sometimes call him bit of a heavy video to end with a cat name but look the human experience is varied and and and we celebrate that stay tuned to the end of the video to find out what's in the bag good morning john it is friday my final day of pizza miss the final day of pizzamas as usual it has gone by far too fast and i have ended pizza mix with more video ideas that i started it with so i don't i guess i could just do this which makes sense because in 2007 i did we did this this is what this was every week so i guess i understand how we did it back then but i don't really understand how we're still doing this now there's something confusing but also really lovely about doing a thing that isn't a thing i think a lot in the visual metaphor of paths a path is nice because like people have been on it and so you can see ahead you know where you're going and you know where you're going to end up i think it's safe to say that this community is off of most of the well-trod pads so sometimes it feels like we can't see very far ahead and i can guarantee you we don't know where we're going i hope people don't think we have a destination in mind we don't but it's exciting off the path high chances of tripping and falling absolutely occasionally uncomfortable sure chances of ending up somewhere you didn't expect very high the exceptional storyteller and video maker johnny harris left a comment on my last pizza miss video i've been a die-hard fan of this channel for one decade now but i still don't understand what pizza miss is and i kind of love that me too and i love it so much like every year i kind of know what pizza miss is a little less which is perfect it's confusing but it's low stakes and it's lovely what is pizzamis what is vlogbrothers what is nerdfighteria like i feel a little like i'm bragging right now but like is not fitting into any of the boxes that have been defined well i'm sorry it's just this isn't what your normal youtube community looks and acts like which is great it makes it hard to talk about sometimes which can be bad but also it makes it so that we continue to be under the radar which i like let's stay down here anyway it used to be that pizzamas was like extra work for me now it's less work because i don't do the rest of my work and it just becomes a time when i get to be creative all the time it's like a creative vacation where instead of working on work i work on a different kind of work that isn't working i mean it can be hard work like i worked very hard on that facebook video there was a lot of sitting and staring and researching and writing and editing and editing and editing and forgetting about lunch and etc but even after all these years making a vlogbrothers video never feels like going to work like the goal isn't productivity it's just making things and seeing if people like them which maybe is part of why we started donating all the profit from pizza mess like it helps it not feel like work if we're not making money speaking of which at the beginning of pizza miss we thought we were going to do some discount codes throughout pizza mess that we said that we were to the people who aren't going to get text messages but then we felt bad about it because we were like felt like punishing the people who bought early that was mean so we decided not to do that but we also said we were going to so as a middle road let me present to you the coupon code nickelback which will give you five cents off of any order at pizzamist.com and if you don't like that idea it was john's idea if you do like it it was also john's idea i'm just the one who clicked the buttons to make it happen and if you're doing gift shopping right now i think the only other vlogbrothers thing we're doing before the end of the year is the relaunch of the awesome socks club just so you know what's going on in our commerce schedule and finally i would like to introduce you to my cat its name has not been decided yet it turns out it's difficult to choose a name when a four-year-old is involved so at the moment everyone this is kitty he has tried on a lot of different names they all fit him differently but we have not settled on a name yet but regardless already i love him so much he's so cute and no you don't get to vote on the name that's up to oren thank you all so much for a wonderful pizza miss the pizzamas store will remain open through the weekend but this is the last time that i will be telling you on a video that pizzamist.com is a place where you can get pizza in this stuff five cents off with the coupon nickelback all profit goes to charity and none of these items will ever be available ever again after this sunday and john i will see you on tuesday good morning john going pizza john classic today so we're all in agreement that speed is relative and you say that you ran those 17 miles slowly but just so you know to me and probably many of the people watching this any speed at all after running 16 miles is effectively infinite i have not in my entire life of 41 years run more than one mile at a time like if you add all of my running up i bet you get above 17. john the fact that you've put together some system of willpower great enough to keep you exercising and and gaining all of the physical and mental benefits that come along with that honestly it's kind of inspirational like that's not something i've been able to do but i feel like you make me feel like i could do it honestly bro you are a pretty inspirational guy a thing i was reminded of when i listened to the most recent episode of heavyweight a podcast it was titled john you are the john in question which is a little weird i can't believe that after 15 years of telling stories on the internet you still had that story it made me think a lot about how big our world is and how no one has the capacity to care about everything um and that's okay everything is a lot of things and you can quote me on that john i have a friend who just got sick with covet and she's fine she's vaccinated she's young she's gonna be okay but of course she feels like absolute garbage and also she told me that she feels really frustrated like all of the last two years of being careful were for nothing because she's still got covet a frustration that i understand but and i didn't say this to her it's just a thing that it made me think along with the podcast episode we haven't spent the last two years wearing masks and enduring lockdowns and being careful in order to eliminate the possibility of getting covet as an individual like maybe at one point that's what we thought we were doing but we can't eliminate the possibility completely it's always gonna be there we are lowering the probability that any individual person will get it because that slows down the spread overall everyone's got lower odds but some people are gonna get unlucky and it is probably true that if she hadn't done any of this stuff she would have got kovit the same number of times but even leaving behind the fact that one she's vaccinated now so it's gonna be less severe and two like maybe she would have gotten covered multiple times because that can happen the real point is that we think of ourselves as individuals but the world acts on us as a collective think of it like voting in a big election like i am under no illusions that my one vote in a red state with three electoral votes was going to have an impact on the presidential election but i still did it because everybody thinks well my one vote won't matter then no one votes and that's not a very good democracy so why this anecdote in the middle of this video well because you've been caring about a person for years who you would have had no connection with if not for a very peculiar specific moment in your life and there's so many other people like that but it's not on any individual to care about everything or to do everything to never get covered to launch a space telescope to decrease maternal mortality in sierra leone to teach every student or plumb every house treat every patient deliver every package plant every tree or cook every meal we do all of these things in a web of care and if all of us extend our care out a little bit more yeah that does make the web catch more things we don't need to care about everything because everything is too many things and i don't need to care about everything because that's actually a kind of selfish thought that's what other people are for like regardless of your wonderful lovely depth of care for the person in your story whether that was there or not he was cared for and that seems wrong to me but it is not wrong like don't people need my care specifically but no usually they don't even saying the words as i have done several times i don't need to care about everything makes me feel gross like it is a it sounds callous but i'm not saying that the things that i don't focus on in my everyday practice aren't worthy of care i'm saying that they don't need my care i can and need to trust my fellow members of the web to do their care i have to because it is a good thing that we don't have to care about everything not least because we can't john i'll see you tomorrow good morning john it's monday and pizzamas is going by very quickly so quickly that it is reminding me of a video that i've wanted to do for a very long time because i'm fascinated by what happens when you ask seemingly simple questions like for example what's the fastest thing sounds like that would be really objective and that you could just answer it and be done with it like the answer is light light is the fastest thing but is light a thing it's not matter it doesn't have mass i can't like grab it also in some cases particles can go faster than light as long as the light isn't traveling through a vacuum so yeah the interesting thing to me is that i think a bunch of different people could have this same title for a video and make very different videos but here's the video that i would make here are the top four six i don't know things that are the fastest let's start out with the fastest a person has ever gone now for a long time that was just running and then it was horses and actually i have bad news it was neither of those things for a long time the fastest person was someone who did not survive because they were falling off of something very high up the terminal velocity of a human body in our atmosphere is 120 miles per hour you can easily reach that if you fall off just you know a number of different waterfalls and the 120 miles per hour that somebody probably experienced while falling off of a waterfall or a cliff somewhere was not exceeded until the 1900s specifically probably in the 1910s or 1920s we're not entirely sure because cars were very new and people were driving them very fast and we didn't have great ways to measure how fast they were going anyway people were definitely going over 120 miles per hour by the 1920s and then over the next few decades we very rapidly increased our top speed until the 60s when we had gone from 120 miles per hour to over 24 000. and that record set in the 1960s by three people at the same time has not yet been beaten and we are not on the way to beating it the three people in question were tom stafford john young and eugene cernan and they were on the way home from the moon they did not land on because this was apollo 10. it went faster on the way back to earth than any other apollo mission i don't think because they were like in a hurry to get home i'm guessing it was just because of like orbital mechanics reasons but yeah that's the fastest a person has ever gone and we're not looking to exceed it until probably we head to mars but we have made lots of things that have gone way faster than apollo 10. but here's the thing that's pretty easy to understand as an orbit gets lower it gets faster so mercury orbits the sun faster than venus which orbits faster than earth which orbits faster than mars and so if you want to get a probe really close to the sun to do science on the sun it's going to be going very fast during the part of its orbit when it's close to the sun and that brings us to the parker solar probe which this year broke its own record for the fastest a man-made object has ever gone with around 330 000 miles per hour now very strangely this might not be the fastest a man-made object has ever gone if you remember my 2017 wheezy waiter paternity leave video you'll know about this but it might be that the fastest man-made object ever was the manhole cover that capped an underground nuclear test that went slightly awry the shock of the explosion was vented improperly and so it all went to this one manhole cover which was then of course blasted off there was a high-speed camera running and the manhole cover appears in one frame of the high-speed film that allowed scientists to calculate that at minimum it was going 125 000 miles per hour and there wasn't enough data to put a maximum on that so it could have been going significantly faster than that that manhole cover may have been blasted into space where it would still be or it may have vaporized as it slammed through the atmosphere either way it did not fall back to earth and that brings us to the final question all right so those are the fastest things that we've made what's just the fastest thing hank what's the fastest thing and if we're not counting a light in a vacuum because of course that is the fastest thing the fastest stuff that has mass well that would be like the superheated jets of plasma that come off of active galactic nucleuses so supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies called blazars blazars shoot big globs of this plasma out some of them like as big as the planet jupiter going over 99 the speed of light why does this happen i have no idea and then here at the end a quick note speed is a function of distance and time and time it turns out is relative and so speed itself kind of doesn't exist but pizzamas does and it's going fast and you can go to petesmith.com right now to see all of the amazing products that we have available now that will never be available after the end of this week john i'll see you tomorrow the fastest thing in the world Good morning John. So I was on Tiktok a couple of days ago, and let’s be honest all of the other days a well. But on that particular day, I witnessed a lie. Or at least a misinformation. It was one of those things where you say “I was today years old when I found out.” This particular person was today years old when he found out that the news stands for “notable events, weather, and sports.” This is what we call a folk etymology. People come up with origins of a word that make sense but aren’t real. And they spread around because they make sense and they sound good to people. My favorite of these is “hangnail.” Cus it sounds so extremely straightforward. Hangnail-- it’s a hangy part off the side of your nail. The nail in question in “hangnail” isn’t a fingernail. It’s a nail. Like a nail that you would hammer into something. And that’s what they call like a corn, because it was a patch that was very hard. Like somebody had nailed a nail into you I guess. And then “ang” is a prefix you put on something to say that it’s painful. This is where “angry” comes from. So any painful hand condition was called an “ang nail.” And probably because it makes more sense for hangnail than other painful foot and hand conditions, it stuck around as hangnail for just that one condition. Anyway, that’s not what I wanted to talk about today. While news does not stand for “notable events, weather, and sports” there is something interesting we can learn from the etymology of the word “news.” The actual source it will be unsurprising to hear is from the word “new.” We took an adjective and we noun-ed it. It’s just a pluralization of “new.” Like what’s new with you? That’s your news. But over time it became the news. Not like my new information. Just The News. And we need to understand that the news is not necessarily the importance. So let’s say for example that suddenly one day, 2,000 people in America die of a disease. That would be news. But if 2,000 people die in America of a disease every day, it’s not news anymore because it’s not new. And this isn’t a function of all the terrible people in the news industry. This is human nature. And probably for a good reason, like the new stuff is the stuff that you understand the least, that you do not necessarily know how to deal with or live with or how it will impact you. But our bias for the new can break us a little bit. Like it can make it so we are not properly understanding the world. This definitely hurts us when it comes to how we interface with ongoing crises. As an example, in most of the places where this video is being watched, the number of infants who die per thousand births is below 6. In Sierra Leone, it is 80. And I understand sometimes now wanting to sit with a statistic like that. It is kinda devastating. And it is also not news. In fact, it is down from 160 deaths per thousand when I was born in 1980. And if you want to talk about it in terms of news, going from 16% infant mortality to 8% infant mortality is good news. Regardless, 8% infant mortality is a bad situation. John, humans have a lot of biases that prevent us from understanding our world correctly. That’s just a thing. And personally I didn’t get this until you like spent the time with me and helped me understand that we are just bad at dealing with ongoing long term crises. But because you did that, and you also did the work to figure out the best ways to interface with problems like these, we now have raised 10s of millions of dollars for Partners in Health. And if you have donated or you’ve been a member of the Awesome Socks Club or have bought something during Pizzamas or have just been a member of this community, you have been a part of that. Because that’s what strong community can do, it can look past what is new to see what is important. And yes, Pizzamas starts monday in which John and I make videos like we did in 2007. 5 days a week. Am I excited or overwhelmed? Porque no los dos? Honestly I am extremely excited and I am doing a thing. So, we have text message updates this year. You can sign up there’s a link in the description. People who sign up for that, you will get messages from me throughout Pizzamas but then never again. So don’t worry about that it will not be an ongoing thing. Everyday you will get one pizza-themed Dad joke from me. I will make this happen.  I’ve got a fair number. I’m not all the way there. I’ll get there. But also if you sign up for the text you might some, uh, special access to some stuff. And if you want to get the text message pop-up every time you can open up Pizzamas.com in an incognito browser. Which I know is a very, very weird sentence. John, I’ll see you Tuesday. Monday! Monday! good morning john i've been doing some thinking about how i became me which is not clear but there have been important moments on that road i was once at a dance at a summer camp for example the thing about summer camp that's a little weird is that there's a lot of people who are young young people but they are not all the same age but they are all occupying somewhat the same like social environment which like looking beyond modern times had to be entirely the norm but these days seems a little bit like you put the high scores with the high schoolers and the middle schoolers with the middle schoolers in the elementary school with the elementary school not sure what that accent was the important thing here though is that like i'm 11 or 12 and i'm at a dance and there are kids dancing in this place and you should imagine me standing over by the benches experiencing some second-hand embarrassment there's this other kid he's maybe two years older than me i don't know him very well but he is a nerd he is a big huge nerd and he is dancing way too much like it's definitely not like good dancing it's not like fantastic dancing and it's but it's a lot it looks like he's working pretty hard at it not that i knew anything about dancing i knew like that you're supposed to look cool while you're doing it which what does that mean who knows and regardless it's been a long time i don't actually remember what this could look like i remember that i looked at him and i thought that's embarrassing here's what i do remember there was a young woman who was older than me like higher status than me maybe 16 years old and she said to me in a very sympathetic tone i know i wish i could dance like him too and my entire life changed like what not only did she think that he was a good dancer she couldn't believe that i was looking at him for any other reason she had misinterpreted cringe for envy so here's what happened from that day forward i was never anyone but my true authentic self and i did absolutely everything i felt i should do and everyone loved me for it no none of none of that what i did do is i took what she had offered though i don't think that she meant it as an offering i took it and like i believed her i accepted her version of that reality that at that moment i had no question in my mind that everybody in the world felt the exact same way that i did about that guy's dancing but she showed me that that wasn't true and in fact that she was impressed by him and she was older than him so i did like start to take up more space and live through moments where i wasn't sure what everyone would think of what i was doing or how i was acting because like who knows like who knows i let her be one of the voices in my head certainly not the only one but one of them if you go bigger if you try harder some people are probably gonna think wow that is so cringe but some people might think man i wish i could dance like him too neither of those people um the dancer or the commenter remember that moment i can guarantee you that because like i remember a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the moments of those years here's the real wild thing they might very well know who i am now because they've seen crash course or something but have no idea that they met me in 1991 and yet those two people who had no idea what they were doing i think had a pretty big impact on me because like putting myself out there is not natural for me like this is my extreme sport like i like this the way that some people like jumping out of planes i had plenty of agency into how to work with that moment like it's not a story that is about me not being in control of my life but like that's a really little moment it was a very few words that i do feel like has had a pretty tremendous impact which makes me feel uh happy john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i recently noticed that days since hank green started a new thing.com hasn't updated in 81 days have i been doing nothing in the last 81 days no so honestly as much as because i want to get my own head wrapped around all of this as you know i'd like to share what i've been up to here's a video about what the heck i'm doing so for a long time now every monday i record journey to the micro cosmos and every tuesday i go in and i shoot scishows and some tuesdays i also shoot bizarre beasts i don't write any of those things anymore i might have a little bit of editorial input here and there but mostly i just read out loud that's a lot of my job now i've also been working a lot today on the micro cosmos microscope we did a kickstarter from microscope mine is right over there it's finally shipping out but we are missing a piece we think it got lost in transit but we're shipping everybody's out and that final piece will go out when we get it which hopefully will be soon in the evenings i've been assembling crash course coins i have a lot of coin boxes in my house right now i'm doing that myself because it feels like a way to say thank you to the people who supported crash course through that thing it's taking more time than it would if someone else did it but i don't know i just feel like i should do it also i make about 20 science tick tocks a month and about 60 not science tick tocks a month why i'm doing that as a bit of a mystery to me but i'm trying not to ask too many questions i'm always doing a little bit of prep for tangents sometimes that's writing science poems tangents is our science trivia game show podcast it's 30 minutes long and it is so good it's been climbing up the science charts watching it get higher and higher is very exciting you can start anywhere but why not do the elephant episode that just came out because it was very good likewise always doing some prep for dear hank and john though having deboki help with the science editorial part of that has made that easier currently prepping for an important upcoming meeting with a partner for crash course could be very good but have to impress them and show how amazing we are which should be easy because we are also working on crash courses partnership with asu which has given me a lot of insight into how education really functions in the u.s and like where it's letting people down i'm renegotiating a contract right now which is not my favorite thing also trying to figure out what to do about shipping costs generally which have gone up a lot which is just how things are but if our ups male innovations rep is watching this hey could you could we just budge a little bit on that one thing you know what it is also getting ready to market our second year of the awesome socks club one of the things i finished today was the list of tick-tockers who i want to work with on promoting the socks this year thank you to everybody who's a member of the song club they have so far raised over 600 thousand dollars for partners in health and they're really good socks and of course i'm also being helped by a ton of people in all of these things who i'm all trying to be a good boss to which involves like clearly communicating goals and values and like what ways we do things are good and what ways we do things are not so good and also that stuff involves figuring out how to make money so that we can treat people well which is like i'm grateful for all of it but it's you know it's a lot of pressure i don't always get it right i don't always know what i'm doing everyone is still learning and like i'm a guy who isn't fantastic at focus as evidenced by this list and yeah john there are also those other two things that we really wanted to do and that we wanted to have out by christmas and then it doesn't like we're going to have out by christmas and that's a little bit frustrating but it is what it is they will happen eventually and they will be great when they happen and they will be greater when they happen because we waited and am i trying to write a space mystery novel sure maybe but like that doesn't mean it's gonna happen also this is oren's first week of pre-k so we're like putting him at his school and it's cute and sad and scary and i'm planning my 15th wedding anniversary look it's a lot but it wouldn't be this way if i didn't like it this way i don't like to focus but there is one thing that i do every single day and it is that i go and i check to see whether or not apple is about to put those sd card slots back into the laptops please all right putting it all out there has made me feel a little bit better am i overwhelmed yes but are there good reasons for that yes and will all of these things get done they will perfectly no but done but done john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john this week i saw a tweet from the new york times being shouted about on twitter it states an organic cotton tote needs to be used 20 000 times to offset the overall impact of production according to a 2018 study that equates to daily use for 54 years having seen people shout about this i quote tweeted the article and said i didn't know why people were upset would they rather not know it all and some people were like yeah i kind of i kind of would rather not know it all and i get this but i'd like to make the case that we kind of have two options we can either not care which like i get it or we have to pay attention and care based on reality the fact that a cotton tote bag might have a larger environmental impact than 50 000 plastic bags it seems like a piece of information i should have accessed is it entirely accurate maybe because i think that this study was based on like a really big heavy cotton tote that like had really thick thick cotton and a tote that uses less cotton it's gonna have less impact though it also will maybe have a less long lifespan this stuff is complicated but it is important to know that just because something is made out of cotton or organic cotton doesn't make it good for the environment it's resource intensive to grow crops if we think cotton is always good because it's all natural or whatever we start putting everything in cotton bags and and we start using cotton like it's disposable this has happened to me i've gotten shoes and they gave them to me in a box inside a cotton bag there was already a box extra packaging can convey a sense of like high quality of care for the customer and of eco-friendliness that all have nothing to do with the product or reality so yeah this is a thing that i think people should know about this actually but the basics if you want to know what you should do there are reusable totes that have a lot less impact on the environment than cotton particularly like the really strong vinyl ones they're like the fabric that a tent is made out of and those are the best option unless if you already have a tote the totes you have are the greenest option they're already in your home or you can go to a secondhand shop or a thrift store where there will be probably bags there that you can buy that were otherwise destined for a landfill so that's the answer to that question but the broader more interesting question is like where do i draw the line between the stuff that i care about and the stuff that i don't and for me i draw the line at the stuff that like i'm caring about it's clear that if you are sort of upset by this article you probably have some cotton totes like that's the reason that you like that's the visceral reason that we got defensive right like i have a bunch and we got those because we cared or because they were swag at a conference my point is a lot of people don't have the space to care about this stuff and i totally understand that but if we cared enough to like imagine that a cotton tote was eco-friendly then we should change our mind when presented evidence to the contrary if we're gonna care we have to orient our care based on reality now is that easy no no it's complicated it also involves understanding that lots of things aren't really about me or you or us which i get it is a kind of un-american idea we think everything is about us but like ocean plastic is a great example here like people think i need to use a reusable bag because of ocean plastic like my bag might end up in the ocean no like you should use a reusable bag because just making things to throw them away is a bad idea like there are better ways to do but ocean plastic is like 50 fishing equipment and almost all of the rest of it comes from places that don't have good robust waste management systems like we do in the us and thinking that like a reusable tote is a fix for that problem ignores the fact that the fix for that problem is international it involves a lot of people who we do not have direct control over it's a bit of a bummer but it's a really good thing to know and these things in general aren't that hard to find out they just require us to look at how we're sort of feeling vaguely about the vibe of a thing passed that into a little bit of reality like are we being sold an idea because somebody's trying to sell us something or is this actually gonna have a positive impact some of what we find they're going to be a little complicated yeah but like simplicity is almost always a lie so seems right to me john i'll see you on tuesday Good morning John, it’s question Tuesday, the day that I answer real questions from real Nerdfighters. And it’s not really Tuesday, and it’s not really going to be me. Like the Nerdfighters are real, the questions are real, but am I real? Shuffle is a podcast app, and yes in thanks for doing this I do have to say you should check out their service, I actually think it’d be pretty cool if a lot of Nerdfighters used it for Dear Hank & John because you get to like react and interact with the podcast with other people kind of. So that might be cool. But regardless, the point is they have taken the tremendous amount of transcripts of the world you and I have said, John. And they have created an AI chat bot that is a mash up of the two of us. Which is something else because sometimes you can tell when it’s you and when it’s me. And so I am doing a Question Tuesday, but I’m not answering the questions. Artificial Hank and John are. Rachel asks, what should I do about the creeping dread? Hmm… I would recommend that you try to do the thing that you need to do to reach those goals. Then turn that into excitement because you’re about to go for it. I mean that one was me. That one’s definitely me. It sounds like good advice. Is it? Probably not. Most of the stuff that sounds like good advice isn’t. Megan wants to know, do you play minecraft? Minecraft minecraft minecraft minecraft minecraft. How many socks are too many socks? I don’t know, 12. This of all the things the AI said I think is the most inaccurate. I own a sock subscription for charity, there’s no such thing as too many socks. You’re challenged to a duel, what’s the weapon? Trampoline dodge ball. I mean, hell yeah. That, yes. Oat Milk Stan wants to know, what do you recommend to pass the time while I recover from wisdom teeth removal? I would recommend that if you have wisdom teeth removed recently, that watching Crash Course videos at twice speed is probably the best way to pass the time. Is it? Like just after anesthesia? Did you mean half speed? Chicken fingers dipped in applesauce or French fries dipped in Frosty? Definitely French fries dipped in something because in something because in any comparative tasting of applesauce or French fries dipped in Frosty, the French fries are going to win every time. I mean with a very tiny exception that sounds like exactly what I would say. Is there a specific reason humans get so attached to stuffed animals? I think it’s natural selection. I think that as we’ve evolved to be more social we’ve sort of developed the need for that attachment through activities like filmmaking, music, art-- still forms of storytelling-- or you can tell a story. We got a little lost at the end there but that is a vlogbrothers vibe. When eating a bicycle, where should one start? I would venture to say the handlebars first. The spokes  might try to escape or rebel, and the tire could explode. That there feels very uncanny valley to me. It’s like it thinks it knows what it’s like to be a person but it actually doesn’t. If you could turn one person into a pelican who would it be and why? I’d like to turn Prince Harry into a pelican because he can dance like one. I mean that’s funnier than anything I would have said. That’s funnier than anything I would have said. Favorite cursed item Nerdfighteria has turned into a meme? Oh god, I don’t know that we’ve cursed any specific item. We discovered the train song huh huh and we didn’t realize that that was cursed, but it’s cursed. I don’t know for sure what train song the AI is talking about here, but I’m pretty sure it’s this one. All aboard the choo choo train, all aboard all aboard. Did I discover that? No. I kinda rediscovered it though, and I like it and it is also cursed. Favorite social media platform? I like Twitter a lot because I get there first thing in the morning and they blur the lines a bit between what’s news and what’s not news. That actually made me feel a little bit too seen, AI bot. Best pizza topping? Not a day has gone by when I haven’t thought wistfully of the pepperocinis and mushroom pizzas I used to eat while I lived in Ohio. It remains in my brain as the perfect marriage of pepperoni and fungus. And that’s some hardcore John Green vibes for you right there. And let’s finish off with one from Payton who asks, what is your new furby’s name? It’s not named yet, so the AI gets to do it. It’s Philip. This has been delightful, if a little unsettling. I was having kind of a hard time  figuring out how to end this video. But then I realized I could just turn to the AI. John, wear sunscreen. I’ll see you on Tuesday. good morning john i am often tempted to make videos about whatever is most frustrating to me at the moment when i'm about to make a video and that is a bad impulse it's kind of selfish because one it isn't really focusing on what's like most broken about the world just on what annoys me the most but also the thing that's annoying me is also very likely to just be something that also annoys you it's not like there's a bunch of people out in nerdfighteria who have like really deep disagreements with me about vaccines for example like i asked on twitter if people who could get vaccinated have been vaccinated and like nerdfighteria is the most vaccinated state in america so it's selfish because it's more me talking about my own gripes than what's actually broken about the world and it's not impactful because i'm just griping to people who agree with me there's an even more important reason not to do it and i don't think i would have realized that if it hadn't been yesterday this week with all of the lovely things that happened around that which reminded me what is so remarkable about this community nerdfighteria is the community that launched a thousand projects it is an extremely productive place we have together made some really amazing things but importantly there have also been projects that have gone nowhere like back in the day i wanted to start an organization called read it first which encouraged people to read the book before they watched the movie or the tv show but then a bunch of people inside this community were like hank why are you trying to control how someone enjoys their stuff and initially i pushed back against that because that's what you do when somebody finds a reason why your idea might not be good but eventually i realized i mean yeah like that's pretty counter to the vibe but the things that have vibed whether they're huge now like crash course or they've really helped creators make a living like dftba records or they're just shockingly impactful like the awesome socks club that has now raised over six hundred thousand dollars for partners in health those things are no longer nerdfighter projects they are having impacts way outside of us because of us john we've worked on projects that are by any measure much bigger than this community crash course has four times more subscribers than vlogbrothers it reaches way more people than this channel and it has a big impact on the people it reaches it is by any measure a bigger deal than vlogbrothers but it is not a bigger deal to me this is the core of what we do and also of course without it crash course would absolutely not exist now i don't want to pretend like none of this is weird this is absolutely weird we didn't know what we were doing when we started we still kind of don't know what we're doing now this isn't a thing that you can go to school to learn and i think everybody here understands that like we're not trying to be perfect like the idea of being perfect makes me nauseated i can't like i don't know how to do it i don't even know how to think about what it might be we are trying to enjoy things together learn together and do positive and impactful things together because there is so much value in a constructive community that shares values and communities like that just don't feel common these days like one of my most successful videos is like my like 26 rants video where i just like yell about stuff but i never did another one of those and not because i'm not annoyed by stuff whereas i did do a bunch of dad joke videos and now do a dad joke at the beginning of every dear hank and john because like that's that's the vibe i think it's very important to be in groups of people that are based on common enjoyment and appreciation and also like mutual accomplishment and i'm really glad that i am a part of some of those communities including most importantly this one it's not simple it's never going to be perfect nobody ever gets everything exactly right but one of the foundations of this place i think is not to focus on what is making us most frustrated or annoyed or powerless but instead to focus on what we can do with what we have and i'm excited to keep doing that with you john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so i'm a bit of a science guy which i love i love the job i love the science i love learning new things about the world but it is entirely possible to have too much faith in the existing body of scientifically supported knowledge like if you take all that information and you treat it as gospel guess what that is deeply unscientific it's easy to forget that we don't know most things like the things that we do know we have a pretty good idea now there are some of those things that we do know that might turn out to be a little bit wrong or all the way wrong it's pretty unlikely but mostly what we have is stuff that we just don't know about at all many times in history people have had diseases that doctors were like you don't have a disease and then it turned out they just didn't know about that disease that is happening in doctor's offices right now like that's a limitation that we have but i want to talk about a thing that bugs me when faced with the reality of the fallibility of scientific knowledge a lot of people will go looking for alternatives and those alternatives might be valuable but they exist outside of the constraints of science and so they can and often do kind of just claim stuff and they tend to claim things that kind of vibe with people's perspectives and emotions rather than vibing with reality we need to be on the lookout for when different sets of rules are being applied to different systems in our guts we're going to be much more frustrated when science gets something wrong because our society does rightfully herald its accuracy and also because of that science has a lot of power in our society when alternatives are wrong though it's a little bit like when afc wimbledon loses it's like well yeah that happens i'm sorry but in order to be scientifically supported information has to exist inside of some really specific and pretty harsh constraints whereas alternatives can kind of claim whatever that doesn't mean that they're always wrong it just means that they are much more likely to be wrong that's what the constraints of science do they make information much more likely to be true so let's do an example of the constraints of science ivermectin is not an effective treatment for cova but this time next year it might be that ivormectin is an effective treatment for coving but how could the same drug be both effective and not effective depending on the year well the most recent meta analysis of ivermectin shows that when you look at randomized control trials only most of them show no effect some show positive effects some show negative effects but there's also a really big well-designed study being done right now in england that will give us a lot more good data and it's a good idea to run that study because several observational trials that were not randomized or placebo-controlled have shown strong positive effects so the fda can't suggest that doctors prescribe ivermectin for covid because within the constraints of science there is no evidence that it works on the other hand anyone in the world can get on cable news and shout that the fda is holding ivermectin back from patients who are needlessly suffering because they are not operating under the same constraint being wrong on cable news isn't illegal in fact it appears to be encouraged now there are also people who will hear the fda say ivermectin is not an effective treatment for kovid and they will turn that into ivermectin is bad and dangerous and you want to give my grandma horse dewormer and that is not a problem of over trusting science that is a problem of misunderstanding science this is one of the billions of things that we don't know yet but we are using science to find out so let's do the research let's do it properly let's do it carefully and in the meantime let's try and keep people from taking their dog's heartworm medication if we don't do this methodically we might end up trusting data that is later proven to be false as happened with the most widely publicized papers showing ivermectin's efficacy which was recently retracted so yes you can put too much faith in science is not always right and if we all thought it was always right it would stop progressing because science is not a set of facts it's not an ideology it is just a system that humans created that is really really good at uncovering truth john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so a weird thing about modern life is that i can certainly forget what happened to me two weeks ago but google never will so because i can let's go back through my top 22 most recent questions that i asked google starting with the where's so i was actually curious about where world war ii soldiers pooped when they were in cities like did people let them in their homes or did they go to the cinema or something or just poop in the gutter what do they do but i found no information about that i just found a lot of pictures of dudes pooping in trenches which was looked awful looked very bad the nitrogen and the atmosphere came from geological processes in the earth and then it's pretty heavy and stable so it sticks around for a really long time that's why there's so much of it and the lunar landers tend to be really interesting the landers they would launch and then they would take back off and reconnect with the command module and then be jettisoned and almost all of them were crashed into the moon to do seismic experiments except for apollo 13 which was used as a lifeboat and then they crashed it into earth's atmosphere and apollo 10 the mission before the one that landed on the moon the ones just flew around the moon they actually jettisoned that lunar module and it went into solar orbit so it is currently out there we could go get it it's just in space now for some what this first one is just me trying to figure out why when where and what can be answered with then there and that which just it can't be a coincidence and i'm getting closer to the answer to this question i'm not quite there yet a pine cone turns out to just be a pine cone i thought maybe it was analogous to some other structure it's really not it is a conifer cone is a conifer cone that's what it is it's an organ of a plant but interestingly physiologically those little uh pollen things on conifers are actually pine cones is physiology something you can apply to plants i don't know if that's just an animal thing i can google it okay i typed in is and i didn't think about using is the first one was is a puzzle a story which is a wonderful question and i don't remember asking it and also is aphid honeydew edible but yeah plant physiology is definitely a thing uh and now it's the 25 most recent questions i asked to google the oil lamps that romans used were the ones that sort of look like genie lamps except they were made out of clay and there'd be a wick in there and it would wick the oil up and you could light that on fire and the oil they used was olive oil meat more what's protons taste like sour cicadas eat tree sap but not the sticky kind you're probably imagining the really liquid fluid kind that's just the water that travels up to the leaves and what is college like i don't know but i think we should be asking the question who we only got one who who recorded the first noise and you might think that that was thomas edison it kinda was technically the first audio recording was not replayable it was the pressure wave of noise being transferred into a waveform edouard leon scott de martinville i don't do french developed a device that could turn sound into an image and actually very recently for the first time we were able to turn that waveform back into an audio file and here it is i do not like that wise honestly i am still completely dumbfounded by all three of these hows always asking questions about the structure of the online media ecosystem phone gyroscopes continue to baffle me and yes we are now at the point where i have no idea how long we have been in this current situation oh there's this catherine thinks that googling things about animal crossing taints the experience so i have to sort of be quietly googling and be like well let's try this and finally just because i guess there needs to be an end to this video john i would like to present to you a poem when did luke perry die when dove's cry when would the moon crash into the earth john i'll see you on tuesday wait another question has appeared how much money has the awesome socks club raised well john google doesn't know the answer to that question but i do over 600 000 and remarkably that is just a side effect of this dang amazing service that will send you a pair of socks designed by a different independent artist every single month they are lovely high quality socks that i wear now almost exclusively and right now subscriptions are open but only for a limited time at awesomestocks.club good morning john sometimes i worry a little bit about how central social media has become in my life like you watch bo burnham's inside and you think to yourself well that doesn't all seem great and then you look over at loneliness and isolation and mental health problems and it does seem a little bit correlated if not causative and then over there you have the erosion of shared truth and discourse and it does seem like the radical decentralization of information sharing and gathering has played a part in that but then like also i do like it and i am good at it and i've been doing it for a very long time and it is fun on an average day i'm really grateful to have the job that i have creating things on the internet basically what i'm saying is that i would hate to hate it because i do like it now there are things that i hate to hate but i should hate like eating hamburgers like i hate to hate a hamburger because ultimately i do love them but they are bad for pretty much everyone involved the question is is the internet like a cow and i don't think it is i think that not having cows anymore if it just happened would probably be for the best whereas i think if the internet just vanished one day that that would be worse i've been thinking about it like i'm on twitter and there are times when twitter does not make me happy but there are also times when it does make me happy so here are the choices that are generally presented to me you can stay on twitter or you can leave twitter i don't like that choice i think there is a third choice which is to use twitter the way that you wish other people used it and never don't do that it's hard it's hard but it's possible since you know i don't know like around january of this year i have started to be able to use twitter in a way that i i actually quite enjoy just trying to make jokes talk about things that i love talk about my life a little bit and maybe maybe inspire and participate in discussion that is productive around things that are not as hot as the center of the sun which is hard because it seems like either the culture or structure of twitter does want to draw you into whatever the hottest thing is that day two days ago lindsey graham tweeted that he would go to war for the values that chick-fil-a stands for which is a tweet that like couldn't be more well designed to create screaming so much so that it becomes clear upon reflection that that's the goal and i did i began to compose a tweet about the absurdity of a u.s senator proposing that he would go to war for a fast food restaurant during a global pandemic and then i snapped back into my brain and i deleted it because this is the exact thing that twitter is worst at and the only thing that paying attention to a controversy like that does is lend power to the divisive politician who's trying to chip different parts of humanity into pieces so that he can create more engaged anger stands i think it's very easy to look at any large complicated system and notice only the problems and say we should throw that away but that's not what happens because usually one you can't like it's not possible but what it ignores is that the intellectually simple thing is to just like carve that out and say that shouldn't exist whereas the complicated hard thing that we're not going to have great answers to it's going to take a long time is to say what actions make this better not how do we stop doing this but how do we do it differently not how do i not eat hamburgers anymore how do i make a hamburger without a cap massive scale many to many communication is brand new it did not exist when i was born we are bad at it we because we are new to it i think it causes a lot of disruption and division and confusion and suffering but problems don't get fixed by ignoring them and i love the internet and i still believe in the promise of the internet even if it is more delayed than i assumed that it would be in short i just think that that promise is something we should continue to think about and fight for john i'll see you on tuesday and speaking of thinking about the internet too much i have written two novels that tell one story the first one to me is a story within the frame of like what the internet is like right now whereas the second one is more about what the internet might be like in the future and as of this week they are both available in paperback so if you've been biding your time the prices are now right and they are available wherever books are sold good morning john so at this point it's pretty easy to not know what to think and maybe there's a little bit of like internet sociology mechanics to that like people will say here's a good idea and then very soon afterwards there will be another sort of movement of no that's a bad idea followed of course by me and the rest of the world throwing up our hands and saying well i guess we'll never know there's also something really normal about this because of course we won't ever know like when it comes to big hard problems we're never like even if we solve them really successfully we won't have solved them in the best possible way there's just too many ways to do it but the thing that grinds my gears about all this is how devoid of data and analysis these conversations tend to be they tend to focus mostly on how the arguments make people feel which i get this is how rhetoric works but it's nice to have data to support what you're saying i'm being too abstract here and i don't need to be so we have known for the entire 41 years of my existence that climate change is going to impose some pretty devastating instability on our world and yes there are still people who through greed or bias or ignorance don't think that that's a thing but we know they're wrong what we don't know though is what exactly to do about it on a personal level i don't know what i should do about it more complicatedly i don't know what you should do about it and if we're being honest with ourselves none of us know what we would do if we were the only person in the world with power to decrease the impacts of climate change in such a way that it would have the least amount of negative impacts on existing people and have the most positive impact on people of the future but let's just stick to ourselves there have been some conversations about like what people should do individually to interface with the climate crisis and we've probably all seen that thing going around that's like it doesn't matter what individuals do because 90 of the emissions are done by 50 companies or something like that which is a nonsense thought right because like if those companies just closed up shop and none of them ever did anything again billions of people would die like you do still have to put gasoline into the truck that brings the food to the store like like at least that and and also the tractors and also the energy used to heat and cool homes so that you don't die so that you you get it you get that so that's a fun sticky idea that resolves anyone of their personal responsibility it feels good it resonates with people it doesn't make any sense but there is a more compelling version of this idea that goes something like look we got to give up on this personal responsibility stuff because this needs to not be individual solutions it needs to be system-wide solutions and focusing on individuals is distracting us from putting pressure on governments and corporations to make the actual changes that will have actual impacts and that idea i would guess really resonates with you it really resonates with me it's logically consistent it makes a lot of sense i have no idea if it's true though and research shows that it's not it turns out one of the most important ways that we show that something is an emergency is by acting like it's an emergency if we are not actually acting like there is a problem our brains have a hard time remembering that there is a problem and also the people around us have fewer opportunities to see that there are people acting as if there is a crisis social scientists have studied this and they found that people taking individual action leads to more pushes for policy change not less the original idea is that if you focus more on individual action there will be less push for policy change it turns out to be the opposite of that as social psychologists leore hackl and greg sparkman said in their 2018 article people don't spring into action because they see smoke they spring into action because they see others rushing in with water so taking action has effects on people around you it also has effects on you it emphasizes within an individual that these things matter what science is showing is that taking individual action never results in people being more lenient on systems it does the opposite it empowers the people taking the action and their neighbors to push for more systemic change so the good news is we do have hard-working people doing research to tell us whether or not the things that we read on the internet are wrong the bad news is that if the tweet makes us feel good we don't tend to spend a lot of time doing a bunch of research to tell us whether or not it actually is good john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john there are three places where you can find orange juice in the grocery store the first one is inside of oranges second is inside the orange juice bottles and do you know where the last one is you probably do do you it's in the frozen food aisle and we have some variants let's just say presuppositions about the quality of these juices getting oranges and squeezing them that's expensive and hard work and the best and greenest and healthiest option getting concentrate that's cheap and less healthy and worse quality and once again still involves some work bottled orange juice on the other hand is the obvious choice healthier better greener basically i think orange juice from concentrate has this reputation as a subpar product that is mostly for people who don't have enough money for the good stuff but i think this is wrong and i would like to make the case for orange juice from concentrate as the best option largely due to the fact that if you're going to drink orange juice which you probably shouldn't it's equally healthy equally tasty equally bad for the environment and a whole lot cheaper let's start with the taste test this is the simply orange which is great it's delicious it's orange juice you got to get a dorito for my palate cleanser i don't teach you that in wine school it works though this is from concentrate that's very good that's tasty that tastes like orange juice orange juice is good and here's the fresh squeezed compared with this oh my god those two taste exactly the same oh my god it's delicious jesus lord i think a lot of people if you ask them they would say that getting oranges cutting them open and squeezing them is the best and the greenest and the healthiest option and my friends it is the best but shipping oranges all around the world so that they're available year round in montana has a huge environmental impact and there also was packaging it's just that the grocery store has already dealt with it for you one study showed that the equivalent amount of fresh-squeezed orange juice required about nine times more cardboard than the concentrated stuff now let's quickly interface with the health differences and i'll piss some people off by saying that there are no they are all glasses full of sugar there is one way in which fresco used orange juice is healthier than the other kinds it is that it is so much more work and it is so much more expensive that you will consume less of it because that's the only healthy kind of orange juice less it's just candy water you've heard me give this rant before but i won't stop doing it by slapping on labels like rich in vitamin c and no added sugar and 100 pure squeezed orange juice and not for concentrate we get the sense that this is healthy not just on its own but especially in comparison with juice from concentrate and maybe this is a little bit reinforced by the taste because i think bottled orange juice does have a slightly more complex and less tangy flavor and you'd think that this is because it's not from concentrate but i don't think that's the case i think they just want the bottle stuff to taste better because they make more money on it so they make it taste better here's the big lie about orange juice we think that what we are tasting is what comes out of the orange this is demonstrably untrue orange juice manufacturers want two things one they want their juice to taste different from a competitor's juice it can't just taste the same second though they want that different taste to taste the same as itself from bottle to bottle from month to month from year to year and that's not something you can do with oranges so they flavor it now what you're saying it doesn't say flavors on the ingredients it says 100 orange juice well that's because flavor chemists do magical things to orange rinds and orange pulp and they turn the orange into a huge variety of flavor compounds so that they can carefully and consistently select a very particular flavor so these are flavored juices but because they want to maintain that 100 orange juice label they work their butts off to create the flavor using only chemicals that you can make from oranges and so they both come from the same sugary soup i don't think there's any reason they have to taste different now i will say that concentrating juice is energetically expensive it does produce a lot of carbon dioxide so because of that even though concentrate is much easier to ship around both bottled and concentrate have roughly equal carbon footprint but there's no doubt in anyone's mind which one has more packaging and so with less packaging a lower cost and a longer shelf life i'm a concentrate boy especially because i'm just gonna mix it with homemade soda water anyway the main thing i want people to take from this is don't let people shame you into buying the more expensive option just because it's more expensive it doesn't mean it's better it's just orange juice it's all bad for you john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i am about to tell you a story that no one knows a story that honestly i did not know until i looked it up in my g-chat archives it's the story of how you told me about the most impactful idea that we have ever had allow me to read you the transcript of the chat that we had on september 26th 2010. john okay here is my idea i want to make a five-minute video that covers the whole french revolution and it is hilarious and it is fun to watch and it has lots of visual aids no one in education even treats it like it's interesting but i mean they made a deal in an indoor tennis court because the king was a baby and locked the door to their meeting room it's like the single most interesting moment in world history except for when the prince of nepal became a serial killer so is that not a great idea me it is a great idea john okay i will do it and that really is how crash course was born except that i left something out and i lied to you a little bit john and i want that video to be our entire pitch to redacted and other venture capitalists because we were pretty sure this was something that we could do and that would have a lot of impact but we couldn't imagine having the funding necessary to do it without the support of traditional venture capital and i don't doubt that if crash course had had to take that path it could have been successful i just think that if we'd done that a lot of it would be behind a paywall right now but thanks to a lot of things going right including john you advocating for it over and over again in the face of me having terrible other ideas which this chat also includes some of we have never had to take investment and honestly that has been extremely powerful for crash course because it's meant that we've always been focused on keeping it free in that initial chat john you were talking about something that we still talk about now we call it lowering barriers to learning some of those barriers are just pretending for some reason like the french revolution isn't dramatically interesting like making it boring is a completely unnecessary barrier but one of many other barriers to learning would be great educational video that costs a lot of money for teachers and students that is a barrier that we are trying to prove is unnecessary i'd be lying though if i said that that wasn't really challenging like some days i think maybe that barrier is a necessary barrier i don't know every day how we're gonna make crash course work it has required a lot of weird thinking on both the how do we make money if we're not gonna charge for this front and also a lot of thinking on that how do we make this as inexpensively as possible which i think is important we need to essentialize we need to figure out what is the most important thing for lowering those barriers and do no more than that but in educational content there are corners that you cannot cut and there are also corners that we kind of can but we just don't want to we want to do more we want to do it better we want to treat our teams and our contractors better so at crash course and complexly in general we've had to be really creative over the years with how we make money with advertising and taking grant money from any organization that really understands our mission and with sub-able and then patreon and now with a new thing that is ending today the crash course coin i'm very sorry if you didn't hear about this sooner because this is the last day but there are two coins one is a hundred dollars and one is five hundred dollars and each represents a piece of our budget that will allow us to reach either two thousand or ten thousand students each one of them is being minted at a small family owned mint in arkansas from hand etched dies and this has been so successful that there will be a different 2022 coin available next year but this is literally the last day that you can get the 2021 coins the 500 ones are probably sold out by the time this video goes up but maybe not this is the very first one that was minted it has 001 on it it's going to the first person who bought a 500 crash course coin and you know who that person was john it was our mom i thought i was gonna fake cry and then i started to real cry a little bit if you are watching this and it is not friday june 25th i'm sorry the crash course coins are no longer available but you can please still support us on patreon more than 10 years into this journey we are so excited to continue finding ways to lower barriers to learning john it was a great idea i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so i know that you aren't super active on twitter though also you are a little more active on twitter than you used to be so welcome back i i do appreciate seeing you every once in a while john green actor this is a button by the way where like you can follow a topic so you are a topic on twitter john you're just a inaccurate one and no i do not follow the john green topic so it's just a little too much to follow my brother as a topic but twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter people so so like there is a there's an active discussion going on about whether or not the right thing to do is to abandon the platform which i understand it does not bring a ton of joy into my life it's a stressful place and i think that it heightens my emotions and it does that to everyone else and at the moment i don't know that heightened emotions seem to be helping maybe they are it's not clear i get told sometimes by people like we aren't gonna fix twitter without leaving twitter i hear your argument i don't think that it's works because i think that twitter remains a tremendously important cultural force wither without me and it is possible though unfortunate for a place to be both apocalyptically bad and vital and necessary and unavoidable because i don't like i think that i can be on twitter and i know that you may disagree with me on this john i think i can be on twitter and be bringing some perspective to the platform about how to use it better the norms of twitter have changed uh and i think that they can continue to change and maybe they will change in ways that will make us better at this i haven't seen any real evidence of this for clarity we're still bad at it every day there are a bunch of trending topics and they seem to be the most hot thing possible portrayed in the hottest possible life and if there isn't something to get hot about someone will manufacture it they'll find it they'll find something from four years ago or this was one last week spare thought for the billions of people who will never exist as world population growth slows the never conceived are the ultimate forgotten ones this article at least if you click on it from twitter is behind a paywall if i google it i can read it so that's so all you get if you're on twitter is the headline and the subhead that's world population growth slows the never conceived or the old of course like the your thought that you are having right now is the thought that everyone had i think maybe the ultimate forgotten ones are the ones who exist but are forgotten it feels like you forgot about that the article is about a almost 40 year old philosophical idea that if a person would rather be alive than dead than the highest possible utility would be to have a population as high as possible and then the creator of that idea said what a terrible and repugnant idea and this is a good way of proving that pure utilitarianism isn't perfect that is an interesting idea but it's not the idea in the headline or the subhead and they manufactured a discourse that was nothing like the discourse that the article intended to manufacture and that manufactured discourse became a big hot thing on twitter we can't be surprised that these things happen when they work but maybe they will work less if we are more aware of them and we do get more aware of these things as we spend more time on the platforms so the reality is that as new communication platforms happen whether that's radio or books or plays over time we develop cultural structures to help us handle them without them tearing society apart and eventually they end up being that goods like nobody wants to live in a world without books and so like a majority of my being believes that that's possible for the internet but no piece of me understands how we're gonna get there which is not a comfortable feeling john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john aliens i love aliens and there's lots of reasons to especially in fiction adventure and danger and the unknown and self-reflection and mystery and revelation but the thing i'm talking about here is real aliens which is a very different thing and i should start out by saying that i think that life elsewhere in the universe is a physical inevitability even if the galaxy were not inconceivably huge which it is the chemical system that is life obeys the laws of kinetics and thermodynamics and while it is possibly the coolest most interesting thing it's not magical intelligent life does not seem inevitable in the same way it just seems extraordinarily likely in statistics there's something called the mediocrity principle basically if you have a sample size of one chances are that that is from the most common data set and to some extent we have pulled one solar system out of the hat and it has intelligent life on it it has several species of intelligent life now there are some reasons to think that like our version of intelligent life as it exists right now on this planet is not super common but zero reasons to think it's unique but that's all preface the thing i want to talk about is why do people like me who have an understanding of how discovery works how science works seem to never think that extremely unusual things are caused by alien and that's relevant right now because there are these unclassified videos and there's a congressional report coming out about them and we do not know what they are but there are going to be and have been many times things that we really do not understand this has happened a lot in the history of our species and it's often the first step on the path to discovery we don't know exactly what's going on we make guesses we test them that's how we end up knowing more things and being able to do more things that's how we ended up with covert vaccines and smartphones and in-depth knowledge of the big bang but also when you are inside this world you know that there are a lot of big mysteries right now that are totally unexplained we don't know what dark matter is but it is most of the stuff but also we don't know why anything exists at all like why there's matter in the universe that's a mystery we don't know how life started on earth also like we don't know why we sleep we don't know where we yawn but here's the thing almost every mystery could be answered with the word alien and that makes it a certain kind of bad explanation we want to understand things that we don't understand that's totally normal and one way to do that is to find an explanation that will explain everything there's a fairly new version of this which is that our universe is a simulation and whenever you see something that doesn't make sense that's a glitch in the simulation now to me there are two big problems with explanations that can explain anything first every time we've ever had something go from mystery to not a mystery anymore it has not been explained by something that could explain everything we've had some biggies that have explained a lot like natural selection or quantum mechanics but they haven't explained everything like for example those two things don't do a great job of explaining each other and the second thing this is really important i don't think it's not aliens i think we don't know what it is it's really important to be able to say that we don't know what something is without trying to immediately explain it whenever we do that whenever we encounter something that's completely unexplained and we immediately try to explain it with some idea from our heads it's not based on data and observation and critical thinking it's based on our biases and on our confusion and on defaulting to something that could explain anything things to know about these unidentified aerial phenomena they are moving against the wind they are detected by multiple sensors including human eyes they are moving in ways that known aircraft do not move are they aircraft they might be they might not be the wrong thing to do is to dismiss these things as a joke just because like everybody's saying aliens in science and in life you have to follow the interesting and and this stuff's really interesting it's weird and honestly i'm a little worried that like the legitimate interestingness of this gets overwhelmed by the conspiracy theories and the just wild flagrant guessing about sexy things that could explain lots of other things but most importantly preferring a conclusion is the exact thing that scientists are taught to avoid investigating potential explanations absolutely figuring out new ways to gather more data 100 but focusing on explanations that could kind of explain anything have so far not helped us explain anything john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john it's been quite a week and i i spent a lot of time looking at a google doc trying to like come back from your very good very emotional video and have something deep and profound to say but i'm a little too overwhelmed for it right now so that was the thing of what do i like to do i like to share knowledge i like to learn things and so i tweeted what's your best fact and then i read through over 900 replies to that tweet and i have selected for you the best facts according to me let's start with some good evolutionary history action because sharks have been around for longer than trees which is something considering that as dr steve points out also trees aren't a thing they're a strategy for survival not a taxonomic group honorable mention shark fact there are individual sharks that are alive today that were born before my country existed best music fact gotta be that dolly parton wrote jolene and i will always love you on the same car trip she was like driving by herself and wrote the songs can you imagine being in that car an extra good fact because it contains the surprise fact that yeah dolly parton wrote i will always love you second fiddle to that though uh has to be the original lyrics to yesterday by the beatles scrambled [Music] i eggs your legs not as much as i love scrambled eggs oh we should eat some scrambled eggs it's like they wrote the weird owl version of their own song first best movie fact i'm sorry just viggo broke his foot i know we all know it but vigo broke his foot speaking of feet though this one blew my mind the majority of the bones in the human body are in the hands and feet unless the person is pregnant in which case the majority of the bones in the human body are in the uterus because babies have more bones than adults look i don't like it either which leads to a broader category of fact that i really like which is facts that are definitely true even though they definitely seem not true like that the average person has an above average number of legs other facts in this category include the fact that you were once the youngest person on earth and that every day there is a person who has the biggest poo but they will never know it was them i like this one a lot the second largest purchaser of explosives in the us is the happiest place on earth and speaking of explosions if the earth moon system survives the expansion of the sun into a red giant which like it might not but if it does then like 60 billion-ish years after that happens the moon will crash into the earth and destroy whatever was left here so it's coming at us from all angles like space is a dangerous place on long time scales gotta throw one history effect in here and it's gotta be that there is a chance that charlemagne was killed by his tablecloth which was made of asbestos and he loved it because he could clean it by throwing it into a fire john our second to last fact is the best fact as voted by people who clicked the like button on the tweet and it is that arctic comes from the greek word for near the bear thus antarctic kind of means not near the bear and there are no bears in antarctica and there are lots of them in the arctic but i have to add an addendum fact to this because this is not why we named them this it's a coincidence the arctic is near the bear because of ursa major the constellation in the sky above the arctic the bear that the arctic is near is barely a bear at all it's a dipper but john the number one fact in my judgment the one that i liked the most because i did not know it and i have believed the lie my whole life is that fingers don't get pruny because like the water absorbs the oils out of them or whatever you've been told your whole life because if nerves to the fingers get cut they don't get pruning anymore it's not a physical reaction it's a neurological one our bodies are intentionally making our fingers wrinkly probably so that we don't slip when we're in the water why didn't anybody tell me this who was gonna tell me everybody thank you for sending in facts on twitter john congrats on the book release and i'll see you on tuesday scrambled eggs good morning john in amongst the set of amazing analytics that alexander daly put together there was some there were a couple of actually pretty big surprises but the biggest one is he did an analysis to see which of us said more words per video he did this using the transcripts on the nerdfighteria wiki they're like 600 on there for each of us then he averaged the number of words we say per video and you said 759 words per video and i said on average 759 words per video i don't know if this is gonna seem that weird to people who aren't me but it seems extremely weird you probably don't think a ton about how we make vlogbrothers videos but most vlogbrothers videos since like 2010 have been scripted so you write a script and i make my scripts like around 650 words long because i know that that's gonna make a four minute video and then the script is over there and i use it as a guideline and i don't really know how many words actually end up saying but apparently i end up saying about 110 more words than are in the script i did not know that until literally today and it seems that you have settled on a similar strategy i don't know what your strategy is but i know that we're both trying to get the most information into a four minute long video possible so it seems kind of likely that we'd end up with similar numbers at the end but exactly the same indicates more than just trying to achieve the same goal it means that we're trying to achieve it in the same way we've settled into a pace of speech that is exactly nearly exactly the same i am entirely aware that we built this channel together that it's content its community its projects are all an amalgam of you and me and also the people who are watching the stuff all put together but i've still somehow like imagined this whole time that what you do and what i do are pretty different as an example when we were on the turtles all the way down tour you told me about your idea for like raiding different facets of the human-centered world on a five-star scale and i made a video called hank reviews everything where i review traffic cones and socks and a half-empty bottle of fiji water in a thermostat in four minutes and then i never thought about that again whereas your version of that idea was years of carefully constructed elegant podcasts followed by a deeply introspective book that is as much comedic memoir as it is historical exploration i was like bang my bang i'll do this idea and i'll be done with it and you were like let's spend some time here despite what i said in my last video we're not the same people and i think what makes vlogbrothers so cool is that we experience the world in very different ways but we share a lot of values but this has made me realize that there's more to it than that you and i influenced each other so much in how we create these videos that it is very true to say that neither of us created the form of the vlogbrothers video we did it to each other so much so that we say on average the exact to three significant figures the exact same number of words will this video have 759 words yeah almost certainly not but you can't see reality with just one data point and when you put all the data points together you get a really specific story the way that we did this and it was not intentional makes it so that everything you make is also very much a thing that i made and everything that i make is also very much a thing that you make you can see the collective nature of this project in the data but john what i thought was an idea for a four minute video you thought was something a lot more than that and it has become a deep and peculiar and captivating and hilarious book and there are things happening with it some cool folks have put together the anthropocenereview.com which allows you to take a picture with the book in a place and also rate that place on a five star scale so far it's just you and me on the site but i imagine soon there will be more you're also going on a virtual book tour may 17th 18th 19th and 22nd you can pick your date based on which store you live closest to or which guest host you'd like to see the most tickets to the events come with a copy of the book and you can either have that shipped to you or you can pick it up at one of the partner stores you can find out more about all of this at the links in the description and as i have said before but you can't say it enough the anthropocene reviewed by john green comes out may 18th and all copies will be signed mine is john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i did a search on twitter yesterday just four words hank john green and sane and i kind of have a lot to say about the fact that a lot of people think that we are the same person i want to argue that number one this isn't all bad and two it might it might be that we are actually a little bit the same person and that's why people are confused we'll get there first as to why it might be a little bit of a good thing here ciara says it well i was like wow so versatile which is something that i would both love to be and also like people to think about me so hey one thing i noticed when i was going through the amazing analytics that alexander daly put together for the vlog with this channel was that like you and i are good at different things the videos with the most views are more likely to be mine while the videos would the best like to dislike ratio are almost always yours that's reflective of a reality both that like you and i have different skills but also that we're we're energized by different things i think it's safe to say that you're often kind of reigning me in while i'm often kind of drawing you out so it's nice to not just like have double the amount of time in having this partnership but also different interests and skills this is why people work together and in order to work together to some extent it's very helpful to have a shared identity and that's the other thing here because we've been doing this together for so long and because our careers are tied together and our our community is tied together our content is tied together we are tied together in a way that is i think really healthy this kind of shared identity where like the success of one person is the same as the success of the other i think some people might find it weird but i i bet you that it is actually historically the opposite thing is weird where we only consider our own success as our success but i'll tell you it's definitely nice because when you succeed i don't feel any competition toward that because i feel like it is my success in fact it's kind of better than my success john i just got your book in the mail and i sort of started leafing through it to like look for some of the easter eggs which have been fun to find but then i've started reading it and then i an hour went by and i had read up quite a lot of it i was surprised by how easy it was to get sucked in i think a big part of that is that i imagine us as as having a lot of joined identity and yet there's a lot about you i don't know and having gone through a bit of it what it feels like to me right now like the biggest sensation i have is that it feels like a success and obviously that is not my success and yet i still feel really good about it this is something that is very good when you are connected enough to a person that their success which they are experiencing in really complicated ways where they're gauging whether it's enough success or not or whether it's legitimate success or whatever we do to try and diminish our own accomplishments you experience in a very simple way look at this amazing thing that this person made i don't have to think about all the work that went into it about whether it was worth that word all i have to think is wow this is a book that isn't like any other book ever ever ever and yet it does a thing that is so extremely hard to do it's almost like you're really good at this and if someday people think i wrote it or they think that you make science videos awesome being an individual is really hard and i have to do it almost all the time and so to know that there are people's heads in which i'm not doing it it's a little bit of a release and to know that in reality there are ways that i share my identity with you and my parents and my wife and my son and i get to share not just the time that i have as an individual but my very imagining of my identity my imagining of my individuality that it includes those people to realize that i am often imagining myself as more than just one person which i think is actually pretty reflective of the reality of what humans are john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i was listening to the ezra klein show this week and he and his guests were talking about twitter and they said a thing that i have said to you and you have disagreed with me about that twitter is both indispensable and dystopian if true of course that would be very bad news so let's walk through the argument it's dystopic because it's a room without walls where everyone is always required to be performing for everyone else and it's a platform for human communication in which there is no space for careful thoughtful de-escalating conversations it's indispensable because it's where a lot of culture is being created right now especially if you are in the like political or journalist spaces and those people are people who create a lot of culture it's also indispensable because so many important unifying powerful conversations and ideas have started there though those conversations are often prevented from having a lot of nuance because of the culture and structure of the platform and i want to dive into this through a very specific and seemingly uninteresting example these two tweets about super villains which both did very well pause the video to read them here's the thing about a villain it works best if they have motivations that the audience can understand there are a bunch of different ways to do that in the carl books the antagonist is mostly just trying to matter which is largely the same as one of the main motivations of the protagonist and that's a fun dynamic you can also have a villain that's motivated by hurt they've been humiliated their identity's been destroyed now some villains just enjoy chaos but i'd actually argue that this is about power chaos is something they're forcing on other people often because they lacked agency at some other point in their lives so now they want to have that control and the ultimate manifestation of that is like world domination but among those other ways one way is to have the villain care about something that is a real problem or at least something the audience sees as a real problem and then they have like a super simplistic way of how to solve that problem that is very villainy poison ivy is right that humans are doing significant harm to the planet she is wrong that killing a bunch of individual ceos can solve a systemic problem gotham's institutions are definitely corrupt bane wants to solve that problem by blowing everything up i guess there are a lot of things to learn from this trope but the discourse on twitter was that either one of two things the people telling the stories want the people who are watching to be less concerned about the problems and more concerned about policing the tactics used to fix the problems that was the original pitch but some of the response was like well actually they're trying to make people with left-wing values into villains so that people will think ah poison ivy eco-terrorist people who care about the environment are bad that second thing doesn't make sense because villains are often motivated by right-wing values and nobody looks at bane and thinks ah the batman movie is trying to teach us that people who fight corruption are actually bad people but the original idea that we're focusing more on the tactics used to fix the problems than on the problems themselves i think that's a perfectly legitimate point i just think it's not the only point in that it's oversimplified in order to make the point and also to make people angrier than they otherwise would be because ultimately the goal that the writers of the movie have isn't to try it's not to change society it's to sell movie tickets or whatever it is we do now they're just trying to figure out how to write a broadly appealing story that'll make 300 million dollars but if you're gonna look for lessons i think there are others that are also being implicitly taught here like for example that systemic problems are the exact problems that individuals are very bad at solving superman could solve a whole lot of problems if he just declared himself the emperor of the earth but that's not just contrary of our ideas of what is good and right it's also actually evil the avengers should not be the government that would be dystopic they are good at punching not leading and thinking if i were the one individual with all the power i would use it to single-handedly force the world into the shape that i believe it should be that's a villainous thought we have it that but it's villainous it's also kind of a twitter thought of course these stories are simple they are epic battles that have to take place in less than three hours and yes of course we learn from them and it's important to analyze what people learn from them but if the question is why don't the heroes in the movies solve big problems there are a lot of answers to that question one answer could be disney's trying to make leftists look like villains one could be disney is just generally trying to manufacture consent but you could take a middle road and say disney's trying to sell movie tickets or you could take a sympathetic view and say the lesson to learn here is that heroes can't solve these problems only we can john i'll see you on tuesday Good morning John, here in the US the moment has arrived. Everyone over the age of 16 can get the COVID vaccine. Over 200 million doses have been administered, and around 40% of people have gotten at least one dose. And yet. The graph of people getting vaccinated everyday, it’s starting to stop do this, where it’s going higher every day, it’s starting to go less and less everyday. And the reason for this is largely younger people, by which I mean people under the age of 50 not getting their vaccine immediately. It could be that you, watching this video right now are one of those people, or maybe you know one of those people and you want to send them this video. So I’m going to go, very quickly, through a few of the reasons why I’ve heard young people specifically say they haven’t gotten vaccinated yet. And first, I think tremendously under examined, is just that like, it’s a slightly unpleasant task that I don’t want to add to my list of things to do. And since now you can do it at any time, people are putting it off. Schedules are busy, and you know that the day after your second dose you might feel pretty crummy, I certainly did. So why not put it off to a more convenient time? But as with all procrastinations, look there’s not really a better time than now. But you also have to look at what the trade off is, like we’re dealing with mild inconvenience that is scheduled versus unscheduled major inconvenience and maybe worse. The symptoms of COVID suck no matter how old you are. COVID does kill young people, it just doesn’t kill very many of them. The hospitalization rates are pretty high, and spending a bunch of time at the hospital is so bad. It’s also like a burden on healthcare workers who are overburdened enough right now. There are also a bunch of long term side effects from getting COVID that we don’t understand super well right now, and those sometimes also happen when people get very mild cases. But even if you get none of that, it’s still really inconvenient to get COVID. You feel like crap, you have to quarantine. It’s inconvenient for you and everyone else in your world. So why not decrease the odds  of that happening by 95%? But maybe you’re not worried about yourself at all. It’s still really important to recognize that every person except like the first person who gets COVID, gets it from somebody else. And it’s very easy to not know when you are the person who got someone sick because a lot of people get sick by being exposed to people who are infected but don’t even know that they are. If you’re vaccinated, the odds of you getting another person sick go way, way, way down. And then much more unlikely, but even scarier. Every one of the new COVID variants that we’re talking about right now, every one of them evolved inside of a person. And we will never know who that person was. But I think we all can agree that we don’t want to be that person. Nobody wants to be the breeding ground from which a new variant of COVID emerges. You can prevent yourself from being that person by getting a vaccine. Now finally I’ve also heard some people saying that, you know, I got COVID, or I think I got COVID, or I might as well just get COVID and I can get immunity that way. Leaving aside the fact that it is a big deal  and you might infect someone  for who it is an even bigger deal, immunity from getting COVID is  much less effective at preventing future COVID infections than the vaccines are. So if you’ve had COVID or you think you might have, or if you think, I’ll just get it and get immune that way, none of that works. You need a vaccine. I understand that every person is experiencing this differently, and also that it’s frustrating. And annoying. Like this things has been in charge of our lives for too long. And for many people, a vaccine feels like a way of taking back control. And for others, it feels like more control that they’re giving up. For me, it felt like taking back control. And I think to some extent, because the vaccines are a really big deal, and they are such a triumph of hard work and human ingenuity, that it’s easy to think, like, I have to think really hard about this. It’s something to worry about, and to fret over. But my friends, it’s really not. The decision here is simple, it is both a big deal but also not a big deal. It’s just not a big deal. So if you need one final reason to go get a vaccine, hi I’m Hank Green. I make science videos. I’ve been making educational videos for people for free on the internet for over 10 years, and maybe you want to do me a favor! It’s super easy, there’s a link in the description you can click on it, put in your zip code, and make your appointment for getting your COVID vaccine. Put it in your phone, then go do it. And get a free donut. John, I’ll see you on Tuesday. good morning john first um your video made everyone i know laugh very hard so good job on that in the last few weeks i've seen a lot of conversation i think because of the release of the book code breaker about jennifer doudna who's one of the pioneers of crispr gene editing about whether and how and should we edit the genomes of people and also of people who don't even exist yet usually the conversations go something like this like should we edit people so they don't have diseases yes and then as we continue down the path as it's getting hairier it's like what about height should we allow people to edit their children to be taller so they can be better at sports but then at some point you get to intelligence and often times the defense is like well we all benefit if there are more super smart people to solve hard problems that sentence doesn't make sense and i want to talk about why it is not that intelligence isn't to some extent genetic like studies show that it is i just don't think that we have wrapped our brains around what the heck it is we mean when we say intelligent i'm not even sure if i have blonde hair we're arguing about whether a hot dog is a sandwich do you think we can figure out what intelligence is but here's the thing we know two identical twins are more likely to have more similar scores on intelligence tests than two fraternal twins so we're talking about two people who shared the exact same environment they were born at the same time raised by the same parents they were in the same womb and the ones that are genetically the same have closer together intelligence scores than the ones that are fraternal or less similar but environment versus genetics is a really hairy thing that's kind of hard to continue to wrap your minds around so an example let us imagine a precocious overconfident young man who has adhd and sensory processing issues and will never in his life read faster than an 8th grade level and let's assume that all that stuff is 100 genetic if that child is born at the right moment and with the right support all those things might influence each other in a way that will result in the acquisition of intelligence and if identical twins shared those traits grew up in the same house had all that same support it would test similarly on the same test but if any one of those traits was a little bit different and i'm talking like five traits here when really there's hundreds or if their environment was different if they had less support if people indulged in their overconfidence a little less those same traits instead of helping a student might hinder us too the potential was genetic though complicated and reinforced by lots of different factors the ability to capture the potential was environmental but here's what i think is the most important thing here environment isn't just across an individual society and it's not just across various cultures it's also across time we don't know right now what traits are going to be useful to the people of the future because their world is going to be different from ours i would have had a very different path in life if it were not for computers i have a sensory processing disorder i have adhd i do not read as fast as the average ninth grader but with a combination of luck it being born at a time when the right tools existed and support what might have been liabilities at another time in another place turned into assets intelligence really is more about what we need right now from people than it is about any particular innate thing i think of it as being well suited to the world in which you happen to have been born into not as some people seem to imagine some kind of on off switch that's like genius not genius genius not genius as a species we do not yet understand the genetics of eye color the idea that we could genetically modify a child to be more intelligent isn't just wild hubris it is also i think a dangerous misunderstanding of what intelligence is if we design people to be good at living in the world as it is now we do two things first we deny the reality the world needs lots of different people with lots of different kinds of abilities but worse if we're designing people to be good at living in the world as it exists at one moment we are depriving ourselves of the diversity that will allow us to have people that will be good at living in the world as it will exist in the future and that is not just a lesson we need to learn before genetically engineering new humans it's a lesson we need to learn for educating enabling and appreciating humans now john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i'm not sure if you know about days since hankgreen started a new thing.com it's a joke among some people on twitter who have noticed that the amount of time between when i start a new thing and when i start another new thing is often not a long period of time canada currently stands at seven days since we launched the life's little eyes tik tok now this is a funny thing but it's also something that i'm simultaneously like proud of and terrified of like what exactly is wrong with me and the website actually has a tiny little link at the bottom that shows you all of the things i've done terrifying but an impressively long list on the other hand it's riddled with failure in 2020 for example there are 11 listed projects only four of them are still like existing things though three of them were jokes like my only fans for pelican pictures anyway because i have this habit people often ask me about like how do you get ideas how do you start things and i can't tell you how to have an idea but i can tell you what an idea is which is a thing that i think a lot of people get wrong so let's walk through the three main stages of intentional creation the thought the idea and the thing thoughts are not ideas here's an example of some thoughts gosh we sure do need to raise a lot of money for a maternal center of excellence in sierra leone creators at dftba.com seem to be having a lot of success with socks lately wow i am amazed by the number and quality of independent artists out there those are not things that have anything to do with each other but more importantly they're not going anywhere they're not pointing in a direction i find it useful to have a list of thoughts that might go somewhere i don't know where they're going and no you can't see it it is a silly place ideas are when you combine some thoughts together and at the end of the combination you have an objective you would like to accomplish and a way to get there some kind of path for our example an idea might be what if there was a sock subscription where every month you got a sock from a different independent artist and 100 of the profit went to charity there's a goal there and there's a bunch of thoughts that we think are true that are going to help us get to that goal we have combined our thoughts together to have an objective and a way to get to it and then there's the part where you make the idea a thing the implementation the work the awesome socks club has now donated over 200 000 to the maternal center of excellence in sierra leone but getting it to this point and continuing to keep it alive is a whole thing like there's a lot of people involved i just happen to know a person here in missoula montana who's in the sock business like i don't know if we could have done it without her and of course in the act of implementation your idea changes like we originally thought that our artists were going to be one of our main marketing vehicles but then we realized that we didn't want to share all of the socks we wanted most of them to be surprises and it would be weird for artists to be marketing a thing that they couldn't show to people so we changed our marketing strategy to include a bunch of tick-tock people who i had met recently and now it's its own existing thing but it's still an idea but also and this is often the case and how businesses happen it started to spin off new ideas like we have this thing now and it's working so what else can we do with that which is why i've never done this before i am looking for a product lead and co-founder for a new business that i want to start there's an application for that job in the description let people who you think are cool and interesting and might want to work on something exceptionally weird know about it john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i don't hear anybody say this and i know that there's like not a guinness representative there to confirm it or anything but i'm fairly certain that you have signed your name more than anyone else on earth you may have signed your name more than anyone else who's ever existed and this isn't like wow what a profound feat is more like why would anyone do that which is the thing that's worth asking like you're upwards of 600 000 times now and so it's a little bit like okay what's going on signed copies of books are a thing and they tend to be more valuable there are a bunch of really valuable ones out there harper lee didn't sign a ton of copies of to kill a mockingbird so one of those goes for upwards of 20 000 bucks jd salinger signed very few things so an envelope with his name on it is for sale for 1400 right now shakespeare lived before signing books with a thing and also all of his stuff is like super old now also all of his signatures look totally different and all very bad but i'm sure if one of them came up for auction some rich person would pay millions of dollars for it but john you have taken a thing that became a thing and done something exceptional with it and in comparison to these people whose signatures are worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars yours has an exceptional distinction you have the least valuable signature of any author in the world but also not i've got a whole thing planned let me get there all copies of the first edition of the fault in our stars were signed except there were a tiny tiny number that were in effect misprints these copies without signatures were the result of mistakes and that makes unsigned first editions of the fault in our stars extremely rare and rare things are more valuable and so your signature on a copy of the first edition of the fault in our stars makes it less valuable it has negative value and yet you kept doing it you went from 150 000 for tiffios to 200 000 for turtles all the way down now 250 000 for the anthropocene review you have flooded the market with your signature it makes those books no more valuable they can't because they all are signed now there are some rare ones that can be worth more there are some that got bound with two signature pages in it that's a misprint as well that's that's valuable and there are yetis and spirals and pokemon balls and hangler fish and whoever ends up with that last page which is a handwritten review of what it's like to sign your name 250 thousand times like that'll be a nice day for that person probably that one will be worth more than the rest of them but mostly signing this many times doesn't add value except of course also it does we've been talking so far about like the collector's market and this like really sort of strange human instinct of collecting things that feel valuable because they are rare etc that kind of value i think is completely separate from the kind of value that you are creating when you're doing this like lovely ritualized signing thing my thoughts are that this is a kind of tangible symbol of appreciation for the reader and i think that like all authors are really deeply appreciative of readers and we don't have great ways to show it it's not about increasing the monetary value of the book it's about recognizing that readers are more than just numbers that they're people the words in a book are the author's words but they were put there by a machine we all know this that doesn't make them any less the author's words but it is a kind of disconnect by putting one thing in the book that was not made by a machine i think the book lives in a different way and i don't know if this is a thing that anybody knows but the idea of signing an entire print run of a book wasn't a thing before you decided it could be i remember those times it was not an easy thing to get done but you and the people at penguin figured out how to make it happen and that's reflective of a thing about you which is that you like to try to imagine different ways of doing things like is something possible it should be let's figure out how to do it and that's a habit that i think is more well reflected in this new book than any of your previous books and it's just like a cool thing about you so i just wanted to say congratulations and that the anthropocene reviewed is out may 18th you can pre-order it wherever books are sold and all pre-orders will be signed john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i once witnessed two women talking to each other about how they can't help but judge other moms who take their kids to mcdonald's and this you know made me kind of mad it's not the greatest injustice in the world but come on even leaving beside the fact that not every mom has the same amount of money and free time that you have people understand the world differently some people see fast food as a less healthy but simple and tasty option some people see it as cruel garbage that they would never subject their children to and like the reality is fast food isn't good there are better options for the environment and our bodies but like we're all humans experiencing the world differently so make your fast food decisions and leave the judgment out of it we're headed into a part of this pandemic where things are going to be less clear sometime in the next month 25 of the people in the u.s will be fully vaccinated and a lot of them will be the most at risk people sometime in the next few months mask mandates are going to be lifted even in places where the governors aren't doing weird political signaling to their base and i'm worried about this stage of the pandemic being pretty stressful what behavior becomes okay when you're vaccinated what behavior is okay when most people are vaccinated who's gonna decide those things and how are we going to judge each other for our behavior and when we do judge each other what does that do for our conception of our society and each other here's the true thing the goal of vaccines and behavioral changes are the same and they are twofold one we do these things so that the individual doing the thing doesn't get sick or gets less sick but even more importantly number two the virus spreads more slowly because there are fewer people shedding it that second thing is the real goal of public health advice slowing the spread of the disease kicks ass especially when every sick person infects fewer than one other person because that's when it stops active exponential spread and instead you just have little outbreaks and look kovid isn't going away like maybe ever but it will be much less of a problem in places where lots of people give vaccines and so i think i hope that we will transition into it being less big of a deal and we're gonna have to decide for ourselves what behaviors are okay but to what extent are we gonna decide also for other people what behaviors are okay and a society does have an acceptable disease burden in the u.s every year something like 30 000 people die of flu some of those people are infants and children and we vaccinate and we tell people to wash their hands and stay home when they're sick but we did all this stuff that we did before with that situation now was that the right thing to do i don't know but we acted as if it was every individual person's decisions matter and different people will make different decisions and people who are more careful are going to average the people who are less careful and those behavioral changes will average with the efficacy of the vaccine and the result will be the total disease burden so yes people who are more careful who are able to be more careful will be helping the people who are less careful whether that's because they can't be or they don't want to be or because they've bought into a different version of reality than i have different people are going to understand risk differently they're going to understand citizenship differently they're going to understand societal impact differently and the importance of behavior change is going to slide out as the importance of the vaccines slide in as long as nothing goes terribly wrong my advice what i'm gonna do keep taking precautions i'm gonna keep wearing a mask at the grocery store when i'm fully vaccinated because there's still a small chance i could spread the disease but here's the point i'm also really worried that we've all spent a year cooped up looking at social media where the average stranger you hear about sucks pretty hard because like strangers who don't suck don't get turned into memes plus we're exiting four years of having a president whose favorite pastime was fanning the flames of anger and frustration with each other and now we have this symbol of how we understand the world literally strapped to our face or not and i'm worried about in myself and in other people the judgment and frustration that's going to come with seeing people acting differently than i would act especially with our new seemingly higher than ever skepticism about whether or not our neighbors are good people i feel like that takes like an existing wound of judgment and frustration and skepticism about the the goodness of humans in our society and makes that wound deeper and harder to heal i don't really want to play that game but also i'm not sure i can stop myself so that's just a thing i'm worried about jon i'll see you on tuesday good morning john preface i don't know when this is gonna end but i did just get my first vaccine shot so i'm feeling good i'm starting to wonder what a lot of people are wondering which is like what do we keep and what do we not keep i don't know why this stuck with me but this is something my boss said to me when i worked at walmart he said it's 10 or 100 times easier to keep somebody coming to the same store than to attract them to a new store which was him saying like we need to treat our customers really well because we lose them it's very hard to get them back the point is our behavior is sticky we are creatures of habit and doing the same thing like going to the same store has like benefits to it i know when it's gonna be busy i know where the ketchup is and where the peanut butter is the peanut peanut butter is put all over different stores no one can agree where it goes every activity has built-in costs of switching we incurred a lot of costs switching to this new way and now like a lot of this seems pretty normal there's a lot of behaviors that have changed and i'd like some of them to go back to the way they were and like some of them to stay the way that they are like me wearing a mask on an airplane why wasn't i doing that before but there's another dimension to this it's not just the things that i'd like to keep doing versus the things that i'd like to go back to how they were before the pandemic there's also whether or not those things are actually gonna happen like i would like to never travel for business again and that's been a nice thing for me this year i'm going to though and so with what is possibly an over abundance of hope i have created my personal post-covered behavior change alignment chart things that i want to go back to that will definitely will happen include hugging hugging people other than my wife and son and then on the opposite from that there's the things that i would frankly like to keep but will not like never traveling for business also in that quadrant i'm afraid zoom calls with old friends like we started doing this because of the pandemic i'm not sure that we'll be able to keep it up even though i do like it there's only one thing in my want to go back to but may not be able to quadrant and that is feeling like safe around strangers in the way that i used to i'm not sure how long this is gonna take but like right now i think i would be pretty uncomfortable in a big crowded room the nice thing about this is that it also sort of like lets you experience the extremes of these things like i kind of want to go see a movie but not that bad like i'm gonna go see movies again but if we're being honest and like i know i've got a four-year-old so that's a little more complicated for me but like and there is stuff that i'd like to keep the same and i think that i will like i want to do more telemedicine now i'm not sure if i'll be able to if my doctor will provide that option but it's been great it's hard for me a person who has a lot of advantages and privileges to get to the doctor's office why would we make a single mom like get child care so that she could get to the doctor's office and wait there in order to get a prescription for a uti that will require the exchange of like 15 words that's not an efficient system for anyone but a less extreme thing and more likely to actually happen a lot of my favorite restaurants started doing delivery when they didn't before and i kind of like having a night in where i don't have to do dishes but also don't have to go anywhere with a four-year-old i've posted a blank version of the post-covered behavior change alignment chart if you want to fill out your own and post it on twitter you can use a hashtag i'll put it in the description but i think the most important part of this exercise for me has been some of these things are going to be my choice and some of them aren't and it's nice to think what might happen what i might do but it's also possible that i'll be wrong and i will end up not doing the thing because behavior is really sticky but a message to future hank if you're watching this if you're not having your friends over to like hang out as often as possible what are you thinking get your butt together this hank misses it so much do me a favor give them a call make them some margaritas john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so you say that i have successfully rebranded myself away from being a corn dog lover while you are stuck with being a pizza lover and i had a little bit of a crisis about it which is ludicrous of course but i did so we're there the reality is like i still have a corn dog i'd probably prefer a corn dog to pizza and i still eat corn dogs a lot they're just not like part of the lore anymore which is interesting there's a lot of things that aren't part of the lore anymore like a couple of years ago i couldn't shut up about metamucil and i still use metamucil and i still stand by metabolism fantastic product that creates good outcomes there's so much lore that i've like forgotten about a lot of it was i like into my little pony for a while like or maybe i like talked about it and people were like actually hank back off from that a little bit and so i just did without really asking why why right before i recorded this video i actually ordered a pizza and they asked me my name and i said hank green and they said i love your tick tocks and so i asked if i could record them here it is what do you know about me from my tick tock you are an intelligent well-spoken person who brings up topics that are very interesting good and it's a nice educational break in my tick tock reel so that's one conception of who i am they didn't know about all like the pelican stuff or the bean stuff or the don't eat stuff stuff and i am on the pelican train a lot on tick tock but like they're not the most successful tick tocks so that person didn't encounter them my affinity for pelicans it's like not a thing anywhere else i don't talk about pelicans on twitter that much a little bit now this raises a question and people ask me this question sometimes is it weird that like you are a different person in different places and no it's not i don't know if this is like because i'm just this way or because i've been doing it so long and i've gotten used to it or if it's just like people are just this way because like to some extent we are different people to our parents than we are to our friends than we are to our wives than we are to our kids and like you not john but like you everybody else you know that like a facet of my job not the only piece but a par a part of my job is that i'm a professional performer like i perform and i change my performance based on the medium and the content and the audience any performer does that but on the internet you're supposed to be your authentic self and so being a performer like that's that's antithetical to that right except no it's not because you watched me become a professional performer like if you've seen all the vlogbrothers videos and let's be honest you haven't i have you know i didn't start out a professional performer right like go back and watch 2007 videos not professional caliber but also none of these people aren't me and the more i act away on the internet the more i actually am that way this isn't even a surprise to me anymore like you change you change your whole life you are different you are different one year than you are another one but i am in the pelicans is that something that catherine did to me she like loved them first and she like got me into pelicans and i do honestly love pizza john and i do honestly love them ep giants and like i there are lots of things i love do i manufacture my quirk for the internet i don't know that's a terrifying question i don't think so i have always been a goofy silly guy you could ask my high school friend but maybe i was manufacturing my quirks back then maybe we're all manufacturing our quirks and if so it doesn't matter because we're all manufacturing ourselves there is no authentic self i was not born away i have created this person that i am so to consolidate the crisis i am a professional internet creator performer person personality unless i am supposed to be authentically myself and i cannot be that and so here's what i can be authentically confused about or even authentically disinterested in who my authentic self even is john i'll see you on tuesday am i a bit much no one ever says that to me but i think i might be a bit much like i think if i met me i'd be like that guy's a bit much good morning john february was uh for me personally for the world at large a little rough but also it was good a lot of people started getting vaccines including a lot of people that i know and love and care about a mean petulant victimhood based presidency was being quickly maybe a little too quickly forgotten which has been a relief and then unrelated to any of that except that it persevered through it the perseverance rover landed safely and spectacularly on the surface of mars and like other cool stuff is happening too like spacex is learning how to land a new rocket you know slowly and mrna therapies are proving to be potentially useful beyond just this vaccine into a lot of different things that will improve human health and life and as disastrous as this year has been for education it has started to feel a little bit like a wake-up call that we don't need it to increase in cost dramatically every single year that there might be other ways to do this without raising the barriers as high as they will go it's possible that we're not going to learn anything from any of this but my mood is elevated it is good and this may have something to do with the fact that like going into this winter everyone in montana who i knew was like this is going to be very bad and then once we were in it it was but no one said anything we just head down went through it yes it sucks outside and we can't go anywhere else inside except for our own homes safely so we will just do it and not mention it and now it is nice outside we have plenty of winter left don't get me wrong but spring is definitely coming and we're definitely on the other side i'm starting to feel like what i'm experiencing isn't just hope it's joy i see spring and i know that it's coming and i'm not just talking about the weather a piece of me and a lot of like the world outside of me as well is kind of encouraging me not to feel this feeling some of that is definitely wise like we don't know what the future holds we should not let our guard down there may yet be twists and turns in this thing but some of it is a little bit self-indulgent it's like my brain's saying but it could have gone so much better but we didn't have to have it be this bad if only these people had done x if only the government had done well and like yes absolutely brain you are correct it didn't have to be this bad but look i kind of don't want to think about the winter during the spring learn from it yes whine about it i don't think so like i don't know who i serve by being mad at people who don't care that i am mad at them who don't know that i'm mad at them i'm trying to let go of that but then the last reason my mind is discouraging me from feeling good is just the reality of the injustice of this disaster of future disasters of the world in general even absent pandemics or climate change or whatever i worry and i wonder about the selfishness of the emotions that i'm feeling so i've been thinking about what to do with that and here's where i'm at right now i don't know if it's where i'll be at tomorrow i think instead of asking myself what emotion is appropriate right now which seems like a labyrinth that i can enter and then never leave i'm gonna try to ask what am i feeling why am i feeling it and is this an emotion that's gonna inspire uh depression or complacence or like better action in the world positive impact on myself my family and the rest of everybody else and if i feel like the feeling is going to improve things for me and for the world i'm not going to ask myself to stop feeling it even if it's a nice feeling and i'll tell you it's nice to feel nice feelings that's where i'm at right now anyway john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john today oren was bouncing on the couch and he was singing the abc song he has a lot of energy these days it's very good and as per usual when he got to h i j k he sang h i k j element o p and this has been going on since he learned the alphabet song like almost two years ago now but this time i looked at him and i was like that's a little kid now like eventually he's gonna have to learn the alphabet in the correct order like he has the whole rest of the thing right and then i was like well does he because it's not like there's a good reason it's in alphabetical order so if he says kj instead of jk who care except then i was like actually no it's arbitrary there's no reason why it's that way but there is a reason why it's a way porn's gonna have to at some point uh be able to look things up in alphabetical order and this isn't something that i'm worried about when he was two he used to always say when referring to himself he would call himself you like you have to go to the bathroom or you are thirsty and i'm like i get what you mean and it makes sense right we call him you and he's up here being like okay so i'm you and i'm like no you are you like for a two-year-old whose whole world is very new the following sentence isn't very easy to parse no you're you no you're me when you're talking about you you're me but eventually without us even noticing it like one day he was just saying i instead of you so like there's nothing i'm worried about he's gonna get j and k right eventually but this whole thing made me think about another thing as it so often does which is that just because something is arbitrary doesn't mean it isn't useful and i think that we get those things mixed up a lot whether something has a reason for being the way it is has no impact on whether or not it's useful in fact there are lots of things that have great reasons for being the way that they are but that's actually not useful like the keyboard there's there's a reason why it's laid out this way it's just not a good reason anymore so mechanical typewriters didn't get jammed like we don't need to worry about that it's full of electrons but once it was that way we're not gonna change this is permanent now it maintains its utility because i need to be able to sit down at a different computer and still be able to type the biggest example of this of course is language none of these words need to be the words that they are like there's no reason that the sound protein bar needs to be like that's just a weird noise like okay yes it's a bar and it's got protein in it but both of those words that was a bad example ear ear doesn't need to be called an ear but everybody needs to call it the same thing that has tremendous utility as we see when we go to places where people speak different languages now this is usually the point in the vlogbrothers video when i would tie this interesting little thing that i had a thought about into something that's relevant to your life or maybe even to like the the world as it exists right now i thought hank was just being silly and making noises and then he really tied it in to like robin hood and gamestop stocks maybe i'm too stressed out i haven't been sleeping great i've got you know just thinking about stuff that needs to get fixed in one way or another and so i kind of got nothing like i got a couple of things but it would have been way too hard to get deep into how i feel like this impacts us on a deeper human societal level so i just gave up is that the point of the video sometimes you can get halfway through something and be like uh well this is good enough i don't need to wrap it up in a nice pretty bow i'm just here in your youtube subscription box to say that just cause something's arbitrary doesn't mean it's useless that's it we exist in a stew of completely made-up things that don't exist for any particular reason there was no system applied to their creation and yet they remain dramatically useful to con to the continued existence of ourselves and our society i'll see you on tuesday good morning john it's been a time it's been a week it's been a month it's been a year the perseverance rover is on the surface of mars the project for awesome was amazing and john it is time for me to do my first ever inaugural meme review when i have asked nerdfighteria if it's okay for this video to be long and they said yes because it has to be we must do the memes justice now most of you are thinking right now oh that's nice hank's got a picture of the perseverance rover's first image of mars behind him close the beans didn't stop coming that's right beanie soon ferbs you're famous they love you everybody loves you i'm aware that not everybody loves beanies sanford we don't have to let them know that though i have to apologize for one thing is that which is that i downloaded all these throughout the project for awesome and so i didn't like maintain any context i have no idea who made any of these things so up front let me say thank you to everyone who made these like these aren't things that just appeared out of the ether people worked hard to make this stuff sometimes more hard than other times some people worked hours on things some less than that john on my desktop i got a folder called beanbee and it contains four other folders bean memes just beans normal memes and art so we're gonna go through a selection of each one of those let's start with just normal memes this was the one that started out the project for awesome for me it's sue from glee and the thing that i like about this so much is it could have been i am going to donate to a product that is so awesome that's the choice i would make but this choice is so much better it's me i am once again asking for your financial support we're starting with project for awesome specific memes here there shouldn't be too many beans here uh well here's one dang it that didn't take long i was having a hard time saying beanie sand verbs for a long time uh so i've ended up with a lot of cards this is a good one for awesome perks they take time to make and uh and i want to be careful which i have not been in the past that i do not end up in a situation where i'm over promising on my ability so this pink blob is just all the other stuff that i have to do i love that's what i look like that is an accurate picture of my face right there a spray-painted anglerfish is something that can actually be so personal my strange addiction i'm constantly donating yeah good kitties i love the memes that are encouraging donations and there's plenty of them this is another one when the matching fun hits a large donation the size of a small donation is completely blocking each it's the boulder it's the boulder meme you guys brain scrambled egg wallet p4a it's a dangerous day to get paid um was that was the tagline of like the project for awesome 2014 or something it's true but we're not denying it it's harder to make good sound financial decisions during the project for awesome give directly to p4i do not pass go please donate 200 thank you to everybody who followed their monopoly card look the project for awesome does make me feel better about the future and humanity more money irresponsibility yeah oh this one's good the project for awesome digital bundle it's got all the infinity stones in it you can't help yourself i mean it is okay it is watch the p4a and you buy your perk early and donate to charity but you keep watching the live stream but more cool perks come out so you donate again there is no separating ourselves from the universe and beanie sand verbs look it's not like we created these personas for a youtube channel that's just how he is and this is just how i am oh flula started to call me billy hank because my first name is william uh and then somebody made this i love it i love how as i've gotten older in this photograph my head really sank like down to my sternum i'm sure that post malone gets compared to every person who writes on their face and i'm sure that that's not fun for post malone but it's fun for me thank god catherine came out i thought i was gonna write names on my own face in a mirrored image no i can't i can't cut a single hair off my head in the mirror i can barely shave moving on to just bean memes all of these are bean memes it's nearly as many as all of the other memes put together this one sparks joy glenn and dale of the glen they were our mascots last year our mascot this year this one does not spark joy look look he can hear you oh i have nothing to say he is so big i guess i had that to say i just had that one thing to say i love it and so does harry harry loves it too beanie sanfurbs is better than dave the fish changed my mind and it's beanie sanford sitting at the table so you're not gonna be able to as soon as somebody posted a traced out picture of beanie sanfurbs it all was lost more beanie sand as me turning my back on dave the fish a previous project for awesome mascot to focus solely on beanies and verbs and i didn't even have dave the fish this year junk it's me now stunk is not just adam levine for men mixed with adam levine for women changed my mind it's got the dftba mugs that's so good it's not i don't know where everybody got this idea and then the comeback beanie sanfurb's coming back this one sparks joy this one does not spark joy take that glen of the glenn now it's just beanie sanfurb's asking for your financial support look we were all asking for your financial support it's the project for awesome i really like this one thank you for changing project for awesome i'm literally a deeply disturbing furby made out of beans people again hating on beanies and verbs it goes both ways for example i don't want to see a normal furby no do i want to see a bean furby yes drake does mini sanford isn't a bad p4a mascot i'm giving a presentation you guys are just bean no and also yes i like this one i don't know what they did but they made it look like this was almost part of a comic i don't maybe that just is a picture of their computer screen it isn't because that's the same picture and that doesn't have that artifact they made it look like it was part of a newspaper my reflection's staring back at me from this from the black screen when project for awesome men's i that face that you're making when the when it fades to black and you can see yourself beanies and ferbs this is 100 true oh my god i hate hate that kind of color corrected to his skin tone that wasn't necessary you didn't have to do that [Laughter] oops all beans that was kind of the tagline of the project for awesome this year and i love that they surrounded where the cereal was with beans they outlined it and put some beans in got beanies and verbs is the stonk sky but it's beans and that does it for our bean memes now we must move on to a category that is labeled just beans so this isn't even memes show the scishow logo it's hosted by beanie sanford beans for awesome project and it's got beans beanie styles fashion forward this is a picture from me from like i don't know fifth grade maybe with beanie sanford's face this is a choice that someone made here we have not the only beanie sanford's valentine i've seen this is perseverance rover with beanie stand firms aboard thank goodness someone during the project we weren't even done yet had knitted a beanie sanfurbs or crocheted or whatever that is art that should be in the art folder someone has made my child into a large beanie sanfurbs more art wrong folder chugger of beans destroyer of worlds that's me god those were hot beans the effort like how did you make the wanda vision logo so perfectly where did you find the font and i'm there it's me and i've got the vision thingy in my head oh god inspiration it's inspired it carries so much emotion the mustache the the stuff on the head the eyes the down cast eyes and this was one of the very first things i saw it was beanie sanford's hatching out of the chicago beans it's john lima bean hank bean and it's got some musical notes and i don't know why god that is some high quality turning bernie sanders into beanie sanford during the project this kind of messed me up for a little bit i could i i had to like host a charity live stream but i was so preoccupied with the long long long beanie sanfords with all of the legs you guys believe i interviewed barack obama and also that i didn't cut my hair beforehand they told me to show up how i would normally dress and then i got there and they were like we're gonna need to take you to a store i should have given him some beans travis macaroni was on the stream while this happened was he offended a little bit and then this which turned into a project for awesome perk it's a laser etched and laser-cut beanie sanford's coaster which means we have only one category left it's the category called art this is just gross ice cream alive living gross ice cream with beans raining down you can't forget that they took the time to have a background of bean rain this is choppa's amazing beanie sanfurbs cake i didn't get to see like the moment where you the knife goes through the cake which i kind of wish i i had gotten that opportunity and also i love i'd love to have a bite but i also didn't get that opportunity does it taste like baked beans i know that there are bean cakes i've had them before they're not usually in australia but who knows god it's so shiny oh man if there's anything like slimier than beanie sanford it's cake bean wow thank you choppa lollipop the skunk after doing finger painting oh god it's too cute it doesn't belong here it doesn't belong with all these cursed images this is just good i like that you know you didn't go all in on this shiny beanie santa verbs drawn with circles like john's been doing those circle drawings it's a little bit touching which it shouldn't be this one is just uh leaning a bit more into the shiny looking kind of like uh an arrangement of dried beans which makes it uh much more pleasing to the eye though the flesh colored background doesn't really spark joy i my heart when i saw this one look at this art look at this freaking butt fartman hank green dr seuss carrying green eggs and a ham on its finger how is this possible i do not like that sand for bean i do not like it it is obscene i do not like it in the dark i do not like it in my heart i do not like it on the stream its presence cannot be unseen i do not like it in the night bean sanford's gives me a fright it hurts my brain it hurts my eyes but worst of all i do despise that beanie ferv this is absurd this could be said with the curse word but then that curse word would be blurred i think this is a british accent i'll say it loud i'll say it clea that sand ferbs gives me nerdfighteria which is a flula joke so threw in a fluna joke on top of all of it i died i almost missed this one it's a it's a pelican made out of shiny beans just a beanie saucy pelican it's so good it's so good i don't want to say it's not good oh my god everything about it is so good i don't like it i love pelicans and i love beans and i love the project for awesome like look at this bean covered project for awesome heart oh my god it's so good i but i can't i can't like it it's too cursed this is a thing that i dislike and like at this like at the same intensity and the intensity of both is very high i'm new to that emotion that's a new one for me i'm 40 years old that doesn't happen often oh but this one i just love all the different paper spiral circles they're made into shapes of beans the gradients are perfect it's much more pleasing to look at than actual beanie sanfurbs i mean this blew me away when i saw it luxembourg the superhero of the project for awesome not enough box man was happening love it so much this is beanie sanford's cross stitch really very good i just love being a part of this with people it just seems like such an extraordinary opportunity that like we didn't know we were getting ourselves into and then the results are these just wonderful moments chunky milk make pain go away uh i don't know how to explain that one and then our last piece of art is this absolutely gorgeous i don't know what to call this kind of art but it's got the little 20 21 tag and his eyes are perfect there's a lot of time and energy and effort went into this cursed bean boy i don't want to overstate this but it's these contributions to to community that make me really feel like i'm a part of something and that's a really valuable thing feeling like you're a part of a community feeling like you're a part of change in the world and the project for awesome makes a really big change it makes a change in my heart it makes impact in the real world we're going to be able to distribute a ton of money to a ton of different charities it's going to have a lot of real world impact but it also i think has real world impact on the people who participate whether they are stitching weird bean furbies donating hanging out in the project for awesome chat making memes creating ideas just singing digitally we are here because we're here because we're here because we're here all that is super valuable and i think it can also be kind of hard to find these days so thank you so much for everyone for being a part of this community whether you are around for the project for awesome or not thank you to everybody who made stuff who volunteered who was on the live stream thanks to all the mods and the core team people who did designs who are organizing who's scheduled it was it's a ton of work to make this thing come together but it's value and we all come together to create it is far beyond what all of us together put in like we all put in work but the value that comes out is just way bigger than the work put in and what else can we ask for as people so thank you to everybody who was part of it and john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john the project for awesome is happening one week from today it snuck up on us here it is surprise every year since 2007 we've done a charity live stream 48 hours long lots of guests many goofs and it's very fun and it is starting a week from now here on the vlogbrothers channel at youtube.com vlogbrothers maybe you're thinking i know all this i know all about the project for awesome i don't need to watch this video please watch this video we have changed things it's going to be different this year than it ever has been and i want you to know about it first difference we are going to be using a new platform for our fundraising portion of the event it's called tiltify it's designed explicitly for charity live streams because the like that's the world we're in now this is exciting a huge portion of the money we raised during the project for awesome is people donate money and in exchange they get perks and that will all happen until define now the tilted fight will be open on wednesday of next week you can start seeing all the perks that are available then though it won't be everything i wrote a short story for the project for austin this year called bonker doesn't die in which april may the main character from my books goes to vidcon and has to uh rescue a pig a celebrity internet pig because i can do that so head on over there next wednesday it will be open during the entire project for awesome of course these are all things that are only available during project for awesome and during some portions of the event your donations will be matched so you might give ten dollars for my tick tock trash but it's gonna become thirty dollars for charity money raised during the first half of the project for awesome will go to save the children and partners in health two organizations that are very effective at decreasing the overall amount of suck in the world during the second half of the project for awesome the money will go to organizations voted on by you maybe i'm getting ahead of myself there are four ways you can participate in the project for awesome number one you can come and join our live stream tell people about it change your twitter bio make sure everybody knows and they come and they hang out and it's fun number two you could donate money you could do that at the tiltify which will open on wednesday and you'll get perks in exchange for your donation or you can just donate money at fightworldsuck.org or if you want to give a larger amount like you want to be part of our matching fund you can email us at ftdws at complexly.com foundation2decrease worldsuck complexity.com matching funds can only come in until 12 p.m eastern time on february 10th so email us before then third you can make a video promoting a charity that you are excited about and believe in previously we opened submissions for those videos the day the project for awesome began we are not doing that anymore that was like a relic of the time when we were trying to game the youtube algorithm which hasn't been a thing for like 10 years so to give our volunteer team time to go through the videos and decide which ones we might want to feature during the live stream we are getting those submitted early this year so make a video talking about the impact the organization has it has to be made specifically for the project for awesome and you can submit it at projectforawesome.com we got tips for how to make great videos there we got graphics you can use but you have to submit them by noon eastern on february 10th so you got less than a week to do that but hey every vlogbrothers video is made in less than a week and finally at projectforawesome.com during the live stream you'll be able to vote on your favorite charities to determine which ones are going to get part of the money we raised during the second half it is the most wonderful time of the year thank you in advance for joining us whether you do one or none or all four of the things thank you for being a part of this community i'll see you during the livestream it's gonna be a very silly time starting on february 12th at noon eastern time john i will see you on tuesday and i will also see you next friday i'm trying to dab i can't there's some invisible force that's preventing me from dabbing oh well that's probably just age i can't do it good morning john i wasn't gonna do this but then i saw a former head of the sec on cnbc comparing the freaking gamestop short squeeze to the siege on the capitol and i got too mad and so now i'm here i think it's fairly easy to pull back the curtain here and talk about why this happened why doesn't mean you shouldn't have faith in the stock market and why it is nothing like the siege on the capitol gamestop is a mall retailer that sells video games and so it's been struggling its current business model is not well suited to a pandemic or the future in general a bunch of finance people notice this not a complicated thing to notice and they want to make money off of that now they may not own gamestop stock they didn't buy it when it was high so they can't really sell it when it's low they could buy it low and sell it lower but the way to really make money off this is to make a bet to bet that it will go down a certain amount in a certain amount of time and just like in vegas when your bet gets more specific your payout if you win will be higher they then make these bets public the rest of the market sees it and actually drives the price of the stock down but then someone notices that gamestop isn't actually doing that poorly they're sitting on a fair amount of cash people are coming in and buying ps5s they're not doing well but they're not going bankrupt so those people start to buy gamestop stock and then it stops crashing the people who made the bets get worried so they make more bets so that the market will see that and they will lower the price again and this works for an amount of time they do it so much that they actually it turns out have made promises to buy more gamestop stock than exists on the market someone notices this and they say a fairly simple sentence the finance guys have promised to buy so much gamestop stock that if it doesn't go bankrupt or get purchased by a private equity fund in the next like three months they're going to have to buy gamestop stock at whatever the price is and we can be the ones selling it to them at whatever the price is other people hear that and they're like you know what you're right so they do that they start to push the price of the stock up probably closer to what it actually should be worth considering that the company's not going bankrupt and then the stock starts to increase in value a lot and that becomes news and that brings more people in whether they understand what's going on or not and at some point here this starts to transition from squeezing value out of hedge funds to just a little mini pyramid scheme buying the stock because people are buying the stock and then trying to get more people to buy the stock so you can sell the stock when it's higher because eventually the price of gamestop is going to go back down to a rational number from even the most optimistic perspective gamestop is worth 10 times less what it's trading at right now as long as you're still squeezing the hedge funds it's about that not about the price but eventually those squeezes run out and it has to go back down to a normal price that is eventually going to happen and on the way down people are gonna lose a lot of money now for everyone involved in this this was a gamble this was not investment if you go into the discords where these things are organized it's just a bunch of people bullying each other not to sell while slowly selling in the background to make sure they've locked their profits also it's very exciting and for certain brains mine included that kind of feedback is dangerous and addictive and we've seen the exuberance of this sort of like explode out into other places like there wasn't a like fundamental weird reason why dogecoin was suddenly worth more the important thing here is that this instability was not created by reddit it was created by hedge funds who promised to buy more stock than existed there are some real terrible arcane systems for manipulating our world for the benefit of like the worst people and it's just people it's not magic it's decipherable and none of it has much to do with how the market actually works which is that people buy shares in companies that they think are doing well and will do better and sell shares in companies that they think will not do well now these manipulating agencies should be regulated out of existence they shouldn't be able to do what they do but instead at least in this one way they got memed out of existence that door has been slammed in their face by a few hundred people who figured something out and a few million people who were mobilized in a financial action unlike anyone has ever seen ever in the world eventually people are going to figure out how powerful they are it'll be interesting to see what we do with that john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i recently uh you know noticed as you do that my glasses were disgustingly filthy usually when i noticed this i will uh just go about my day and that's what i did and then later i realized that they were still super filthy and then a day after that i was like okay i'm gonna clean my glasses but then i had a thought what exactly is on them what is all that stuff and i also realized that i have a microscope and so i continued to not wash my glasses for seven full days and so now it is time for me to show you what is it just what is it because i can do that because i have a microscope let's go warning from hank from the future what you are about to see is not great oh green why is it green the mucus okay well there's a big something what's that why is it a color those are all just like individual little dots of grease that down there is a skin cell oh wow oh god is that a hair that must be a hair with just some just some sebaceous stuff on it you can see the scratches on my lens too that's interesting mostly i'd guess that these are skin cells or just like flakes of skin i think it's what's happening and then hairs that's a big scratch so one thing that i i'm gonna try now with one side is to actually put a slide cover on and you know it's about it's roughly the same as what we were looking at oh gosh this just flakes the skin lots of flakes of skin oh that's definitely a fiber jeez what is happening how is that even stuck i mean i guess it's tiny it's this tiny little thread that came off of some of my clothes or a bed sheet or something oh that's a big old hair whoa it's huge oh my god how is that on my glasses we need some anti-stick technology on glasses you guys i'm so sorry to everyone in my family for never cleaning my glasses and i'm so sorry to all of you for like subjecting you to my facebookers and you know a similar story on this on this lens skin cells aplenty just flakes of skin occasional threads and hairs and lots and lots and lots of globs of oil here's another hair for a thread for you what those are salt crystals i think i'm just guessing but they look too rectangular to be organic a drop of sweat that dried up maybe that's kind of cool i hate it it's like the freaking surface of mercury up in here the thing i didn't expect was all of the globs of oil admittedly i haven't washed these glasses in a week does it just leap off of my face oh my god we are factories we make so much stuff with our bodies and it is upsetting oh i have to go i have to go shoot scishow no terrible and i have to clean my glasses in order to do it do you think that's an eyelash it's tiny it's probably an eyelash oh god i'm gonna get some soap and water and i'm gonna clean these boys out right now oh lord well john oh there's still a slide cover on that one wow glad it didn't go in my eye remember to clean your glasses and that's really the whole moral of this story i'm so glad that we got to learn these things together today i'll see you on tuesday whoa okay that's why there's a sandbag on there good morning john you and i are like it or not what some people call social media influencers of course i hate this it's like calling a journalist a newspaper subscription salesperson yeah they sell newspapers it is not however what they produce on the other hand the question of what you and i and people like us do produce is complicated we produce value for ourselves in the form of affirmation or status or income or creative joy and hopefully we produce value for others as well in the form of education or insight or connection or just entertainment and actually we started doing this at a time when income or status like weren't part of the equation like nobody said like oh you're a youtuber how impressive even now to me that sentence sounds ridiculous though youtuber is we have ended up in this world a high status job people want my job and i don't blame them and i don't think they're wrong it's a good job but i started to see the problem with this back in like the early 20 teens when like it became clear that it was going to be really crowded at the bottom to get noticed you have to be better and you have to do more like epic meal time was a show and the gregory brothers were like mixing amazing music with viral videos like these things were hard to do but there were also ways to get noticed that weren't as hard they were just worse like prank channels started to cross lines that were definitely immoral and also like illegal people started to have hotter and hotter political takes and they were rewarded for that one thing i think people get wrong about people who do what i do is that like when when people start creating on the internet it is never about money the actual thing they want is to feel like they matter they want validation they want meaning they want to be valuable and they believe because of where their attention is that online creators are valuable and so they want to be one so that they can definitely matter and when you're in a society that in my opinion has done a terrible job of appreciating many if not most humans more and more people are going to want to push toward that feeling of mattering in other words for new creators it's never about money it's about affirmation and it's about status there are a lot of angles to view this moment from and i think that they are all important i am a creator i make stuff on the internet so that's my perspective and when i see every other hand during a siege of the capitol building holding up a phone like on a facebook live stream i see insurrectionists i see terrorists i see white supremacists but i also see influencers i see content creators and not side by side they are the same person i see people who are both ends of the creator audience relationship their ideas get more radical because that makes better content that gets more engagement and then they consume more content like that to inform their content that they're going to create and also because it helps them feel righteous for making the stuff they're making it's a feedback loop that can only radicalize now this isn't 100 new it's been happening in radio and tv for decades if you can make more money by being more radical instead of spending more money on quality people are gonna do that but when it's crowded at the bottom and people are searching for meaning and attention and status are the only currencies when more and more outrageous content is getting more and more attention we end up in an arms race of radicalization one that is pulling radio and tv and yes politicians along with it i worry sometimes that understanding something can lead to excusing it not what is happening here ways to feel like you matter include and often include white supremacy they also can include believing you are an integral part of bringing down an international cabal of child murderers if you feel like you're one of the only people in the world who understands the link between 5g and kovit it's hard to deny that you are important especially when you're getting a lot of engagement on your social media posts about it and i'm not saying that they don't believe any of these things i think that they do because it's very easy to believe things that make you feel good that is true of them it's also true of me it's true of you and it's also extremely hard to abandon ideas you are appreciated and loved for so if i have insight here to add it is this the words social media influencer turn out to be representing a much bigger and much uh scarier thing than we thought john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john what what this is a corner of my office that i never use i made a set for games with hank in the year well god like 2015. this is where i sit where i do other things that aren't at a computer which at the moment and possibly for the long term is my microscope station i have a microscope now i'm very excited about it it is nice to be brought into a different world that is beautiful and less complicated than the one i'm normally in which this week has been a lot like i'd love to add something helpful i don't have much to add i think joe biden's gonna be president in two weeks i don't think that there will be a coup i think that all of this is tremendously destructive to democracy and our country uh but i don't think that we are headed into a civil war it's very bad it's just not anywhere close to that bad and in fact like what these people want us to think is that maybe there will be a civil war because that's what they want because they're idiots more important than that though i recently went to flathead lake where it was freezing literally there were beautiful waves of chunks of ice crashing onto the shore and because i have a microscope i was like probably i won't find anything really interesting but i am gonna dip my bare hand into this lake and pull out some water i'm gonna collect every scrap of vegetation that has made it through this churning mass of grinding rocks you know ice as rocks and maybe i will find something cool well john i've been looking at this sample which is in this tank right here i just saw something with my eyes which i did not expect but i just turned the camera on i'm going to walk through the process of trying to take a look at whatever this little thing is or these little things there's a bunch of them so right here in this corner there are these little white dots that are moving around a little bit and i'm going gonna try and suck some of those up okay i got the little shrimpy thing on there that's exciting oh hopefully i did not just murder him i think i did murder him well first try as a failure now i can take the eyepiece out of this and shove it in here oh and then i can attach this to my phone let's try to find whatever that thing was hello friend whoa what oh my gosh what a big boy i didn't even mean to grab this thing from this sample and it's huge it is i can actually see it on my slide oh man that's cool uh and we can zoom in closer here get a better look at his insides oh drink the lake okay well this is cool i still want to see one of these little shrimpy things i think i got one i did he's zooming around in there and this time i'm not gonna push down on the cover slip this lighting does make me look like a murderer he's huge oh geez he's got little arms in there there's a lot going on with this guy but i i still can't really tell you what he is i'm a little upset that he can't move around oh and then there's this which is you know still huge oh man this sample is just teeming with life can you believe i pulled this out of just like ice and i'm just like grabbing tiny drops at a time and it's got stuff like that in there see a little shrimpy i'm putting on my coverslip i want to see one of these things so bad wow okay that's a whole different that's a whole different experience the other thing even the same thing is this whoa whoa look at his tail this thing is so fun to play with journey to the micro cosmos is currently having a kickstarter for this microscope uh along with this attachment that allows you to make content with it we're also putting together a little guide to help you get started in your own journey to the micro cosmos or if you don't want to do that we also have the whole channel where you can come and watch us explore and it's really wonderful it's a nice break from things it's the most relaxing part of my job actually i'd say by a fair margin john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john welcome to 2021 new last video you walked us through what you thought 2020 was gonna be like a year ago and how you feel like you did and i just i have to just blow you out of the water right now i am way way far ahead of you because john when i was 10 in 1990 i wrote an essay called what i think life will be like in the year 2020 and i would like to read it to you and then we're going to go over my historical timeline of what i think is going to happen every year from 1990 to the year 2020. i have been waiting for this moment for a long time this is reason enough to have become a video blogger john i think life in 2020 will be really neat i think there will be cures for almost every illness and people will be 200 years old there's a bit of a math problem here if the oldest person on earth in 1990 was 110 years old they could only be 140. that's as that's as old as they can be in 2020 unless we're like bringing people back to life there will also be alien races that have brought new technologies to earth maybe we'll even find ways to make the oh make the dead alive again okay so never mind so there will be no more extinct animals okay that was a twist i didn't expect that actually we kind of have figured out a little bit of de-extinction work basically i think life in 2020 will be cool okay but john i know what you're really curious about my year by year timeline of what's going to happen oh god this actually starts in 1980 so i did 10 years of stuff that actually happened like cool man steve mcquinn dies of cancer who is that steve mcqueen so the first thing i have 1991 iraq releases hostages this actually happened in 1990 but in december so i was close 1992 way of living in space invented the iss launched in 1998 so not too far off 1993 peace in the middle east shoot first community on the moon we have not got there yet 1995 electric cars the gm ev1 was released in 1996. i'm not bragging but i'm bragging follow quickly in 1996 by go to mars so unless we're talking about the pathfinder mission which was in 1997 uh no 1998 100 television stations without a satellite this was what i was worried about 1999 not an election year first black president but we did get that year 2000 cure for cancer i'm sure that all cancer was cured in the year 2000. there's just turns out there's a lot of cancers little hank i'm sorry 2002 only three years after the first black president we had the first woman president so something hinky happened here 2004 true ghost discovered that didn't happen 2008 oil line breaks many animals suffer now i just had to point that one out because the deepwater horizon was 2010. so that was kind of close i'm sure there was also an oil spill in 2008 2009 rainforest lost forever so i thought life was going to be pretty cool in 2020 but i thought all the rainforests were going to be gone so that's a win 2011. i'm not making this up burt reynolds dies of heart condition burt reynolds died of cardiac arrest in 2018. i don't know what to say i'm not right but i'm not that wrong 2012 superior fish beings i don't know what they do but they are there they exist 2016 thousands of aliens come in peace we're still holding out hope for that and what was my prediction for the year 2020 john what was it well i can tell you right now i got it wrong but i had every chance of getting it right garfield turns 80. like why didn't i just look at when garfield was born and then do the math no garfield does not turn 80 this year garfield turned 42 years old this year i could have just looked it up and now john we are headed into the great unknown the time beyond 2020. thank you for making stuff with me and i'll see you on tuesday good morning john we had a great chat on the phone this week and i want to hit you with insights that i feel like we have we know and we talk about together and that we have almost developed together over the years but i don't know that we've talked about it like each one of these led to the next and i think it's useful it's been useful for me i think though it's hard to tell for sure number one it is really hard maybe impossible to stop wanting things but also like is it actually good to not want anything like i wanna wanna live i want to want to make a better future for people like i don't really want to want a new car but i do want to want to spend time with my family so insight number one is you can't stop wanting and i'm not sure that i want to which leads directly to insight number two which is but maybe you can help steer what you want this may be as better stated as it is hard to control what you want like you cannot do it through sheer force of will i can't just say i want to stop one in coca-cola and i want to start wanting to volunteer all the time that's what i want to want but i don't want that i want to drink coca-cola and watch tick tocks but i have found that there are things that i can do to alter my wants like if i want to work more on crash course i have to think about education i have to like listen to education podcasts and talk to people who are thinking hard about how to make college more accessible the more time i spend engaging with those questions the more i actually want to do it and if i want to spend more time with my family i have to spend more time with my family like the more i do it the more i want to do it because by spending time doing it i'm teaching myself a story about the value of those things what i actually see really often is people engaging with certain kinds of content and not noticing how it steers their wants like the content is enjoyable no doubt about that but what is it doing to my wants like there are a lot of people who consume content about how to be more successful in business and get rich and when you consume that content you value being successful in business and getting rich more and the more people who spend time watching people play video games professionally the more people start to value those particular skills of professional video game play also there are a lot of people who engage with content about how to be more beautiful and the more you engage with that content the more you value beauty now this is just one of the ways that you increase your want in something like there's two other big ones one is it is good like it's good to have money there is security there playing video games is fun fashion and makeup are art and the second reason is that we live in a society where those things are really highly praised and so the barrier to wanting those things is low and so we are more likely to be interested in consuming that kind of content and i don't think it's wrong to want these things i do think that it can be limiting if it's the only thing we allow ourselves to want can we either ignore those ones completely if we're not interested in them or diversify from there and this is hard because the barrier to wanting something gets a lot higher when society prizes it less the less you engage with the story the harder it is to want that thing and if there aren't a lot of stories about that thing it becomes really hard to want it and in a way this means that the most successful people in our society are kind of the least interesting they're just really good at going after the default things society is telling them to want now sometimes those people can become stories themselves that alter societal once overall but usually not which is all a way of saying that if you prize just a little bit of interesting or weird if that's the story you're into which i am and that's like a baseline story that you can always believe in that prevents you from getting stuck in these societal ruts not that i'm always great at it it's very easy to get stuck in there and it is very hard for me to steer my not in substantial want but i'm gonna keep trying because i feel like i'm getting better at it and i feel like the results are positive john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john we got a question in the dear hank and john inbox oh who's it from it's from debbie and it is a question that i've been asking myself for decades now we can spell letters with letters which is just i don't know what that means but it just makes my brain go and how they are spelled is of course impacted by how they are pronounced and there are ways that we have decided to pronounce them and i'm gonna rank them now so first of all coming in at number one we have all of the vowels they get to do whatever they want coming in at number two we have consonants that end in the e noise so c t v b you're all fantastic this makes perfect sense why don't we just carry it through the whole alphabet a you can do whatever you want b c d e fee fee why not why why but okay if we're gonna have another system which it turns out we actually have to because i'll get to that in a second coming in at number three we have the f the m the n the s where instead of coming at the beginning of the word we decide we're going to put the consonant at the end of the word and i was thinking about this and i was why can't we just switch all of these over to like the bcd version and then i got to s which if you do that with s you get c come on but there's another letter for which this is true and that is a number four along with k we have j j and k they do their own thing and k could be key and that would be great but j can't be g because we got a g and then we got this little island of misfit toys letters that are not pronounced like any of the other letters so coming into number five we're going with q i feel like q makes sense for it to be weird like i don't know that we need q like we could just use other letters to do that like queen k-w-e-e-n then we have x also is standing around here on it joan because it shouldn't exist it's just ks or z for some reason and now we have approached our final three the worst clearly the worst letter names why which could have been ye and we just missed that unacceptable but not as bad as second to last h h h doesn't even have the h noise in it unless you're british and you say h which great good obviously that's what we should do but that's not what we do but but but h at least contains the letter h right it's there at the end but coming in absolute dead last just despicable we have the only three syllable letter the only letter that references another letter the only letter that does not even contain itself w it just describes its own shape but poorly look there's a reason why we ended up with w and a spoiler it's not a great reason it is depending on how you count it the youngest letter and it arrived in its final form after the invention of the printing press and so it was named by printers who before we had ws would just use two u's instead of a w to make the one noise like we still have a word that does this equus why is a w a double v hank well because v's and u's were for a while kind of interchangeable i have a pet theory and there's nothing supporting this that printers just had more v's lying around because use were more useful so using 2us all the time would use up all of their use and did i make the whole video so that i could say that line a little a little bit yeah john it's the last day of the year when you can join the awesome socks club at awesomesocks.com or because these news are interchangeable awesomestocks.com log brothers be delighted with a new pair of socks designed by a different artist every month of 2021 except if you sign up now it will not be every

that i love it's a book by aaron kubo that i saw as a twitter thread 12 months ago and i loved it so much i wanted to turn it into a video so join me for a reading of the christmas creature gather my

christmas you've been spared aesthetic is weird like i would have to look really hard and for a long time to have a good idea of why i love that story so much like i see a lot of stuff on twitter and rarely do i reach out to the person who made this stuff and say like i would like to license that for a video and then i'm going to get my friend sam to animate it and i'm gonna license some music for it and record narration for like two hours to get two minutes of performance i i don't know i also don't know why i spent like 10 hours over the last few weeks working on my piece of the unofficial tick-tock ratatouille musical but one thing we should know about this is that taste is not like universally good or bad that's our values and our world views and our experiences and our ideologies like the vlogbrothers project for awesome 2021 calendar available now designed by megan tennis like why do i love it so much i think it goes a long way down i think it's a good idea to examine our aesthetics but i also think it's a good idea to indulge in our aesthetics and thus christmas creature and ratatouille musical and project for awesome calendar and these freaking socks aaron kubo is selling physical copies of the christmas creature on her website you can get those at the link in the description same with the calendars in the socks the ratatouille musical is not for sale john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john about a year ago i had an idea and i want to walk you through a little bit of the process of where this idea came from i'm obviously in the business of e-commerce and so i spent a lot of time like looking at the landscape and thinking about it and it's boring it's not boring actually so it turns out that there's a lot of products that people are just going to need in their lives and manufacturing high quality products is getting easier so you have a lot of companies that have very like functionally similar products that are differentiating themselves on their story but oftentimes and i'm not trying to make any enemies here these stories are pretty thin facades over what are very similar or sometimes actually literally identical products and so everybody in this business is talking about how the only important thing is your story and so i'm thinking like what's the best story everybody's trying to figure out what the best story is but there's one thing that they won't really compromise on which is that ultimately the company needs to make money and i'm like does it because if you're going to have a company that sells stuff people need and it's fairly easy to make this stuff then why not just have a company that does that but then gives all the money away this isn't a new idea back in the 80s paul newman american amazingly attractive man and also very talented sweet guy he like made salad dressings for fun and then he was like well i don't want to make money but i do want to make salad dressing and so he created newman's own with some friends of course and now there's this like fairly major food brand that gives all of its profit to charity and it's been around for like 40 years now they've given away half a billion dollars i'm like super obsessed with their story there's actually a bunch of ways that giving all your profit away makes a company harder to run i think maybe obviously but maybe some not so obvious reasons as well but there are also ways that it makes it easy and i think if everything's going to be about story then let's make this story actually good so this week john and i are launching the awesome socks club it's a sock subscription every month of 2021 you're going to get a different pair of socks delivered to you and every one of those is going to be designed by a different independent artist that we found on the internet we've got more than two pairs designed but we're just showing the first two because part of the joy of this for me anyway has been being surprised by what our designers have come up with they look great they feel great shipping is free everywhere that has an address and yes 100 of the profit goes to charity right now it's going to decrease maternal and child mortality in sierra leone but we hope maybe as this thing grows that it will be able to do more good in more places and more ways it's already doing extremely well it launched on monday we've got thousands of people signed up already it's very exciting i did a bunch of brand deals with tick-tockers which has been amazing and very weird you also might hear ads for it on some of your favorite podcasts like 99 invisible and the try guys tripod this is definitely the start of a great sock subscription club like already it is that but i'm hoping maybe it can be the start of something even bigger than that so on this black friday if you'd like to give a gift to yourself once a month for all of 2021 you can sign up at awesomesocks.club vlogbrothers or you can give it as a gift to someone else or you can ask somebody to give it to you as a gift but you have to sign up before december 11th because that's when we close the subscription down this way we know how many socks we should manufacture and there's no waste and also if you want to have a more robust picture of what the uh the sort of commerce landscape of nerdfighteria looks like this season we're also gonna have a charity calendar that's coming out fairly soon it's just not quite ready yet i'm gonna be making a video about this delightfully creepy christmas story that i discovered on the internet i didn't write it or illustrate it but i wanted to collaborate with the artist to make a video about it and the artist will be selling that i just loved it and i wanted more people to know about it my publisher has put an absolutely remarkable thing on sale in ebook format for three dollars so if you wanted to give that a try now is the time also in general advice from somebody who runs an e-commerce company if you're buying stuff uh online this christmas season order it right now because the shipping infrastructure of this country is going is like already very at its limit links for awesome socks club in the doobly-doo john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john so this video could be very short uh yes yes i would take a coveted vaccine i would i would spend 15 hours in a target for a covert vaccine i would eat a blenderized happy meal i would wax my chin i would give up coffee i would walk around with clif barts on my feet instead of shoes for a month i would let ruby rod be my roommate for a covid vaccine the news that pfizer moderna astrazeneca and others have had really promising results in their phase 3 trials it's good it's it's like i don't think people get how good this news is or maybe we're just like so overwhelmed with everything else in the world but it is it's like the best news of 2020. it was entirely possible that this first slate of vaccines and these are the first ones wouldn't work it was also possible that no vaccine would work it was also possible people wouldn't get any lasting immunity from even getting the disease which is true for many other coronaviruses it looks like we're finally getting lucky with something that getting the disease does confer some lasting immunity and vaccines that expose our immune systems to like little broken off bits of the virus that can't infect you also confer immunity now there are things that we still don't know we don't know whether or how much getting the vaccine prevents you from spreading the disease it probably does pretty substantially considering people are testing negative but like we don't know for sure we also don't know how long these vaccines last and we won't have a good idea about that for a pretty long time but i'm very excited by this it's such good news and i will immediately line up whenever i am allowed to to get this vaccine but i know that there's also a lot of hesitancy around vaccines so i want to talk about like the three main reasons why i want to do this first if you are concerned about the politician or politicians who developed this vaccine like you don't trust donald trump or you don't trust your abiding politicians and political leaders don't develop vaccines and the rules and systems we use to test for the safety of vaccines did not change at all in the last year scientists and doctors very specifically for this reason chose to change nothing they looked and they said maybe there are some things we could do to speed it up but we're not going to do them because we don't want people to feel like we're cutting corners there are things that we worked hard to speed up but the things that take time we let them take the time which is why it's taken so long so i want to get a covered vaccine because i know it's going to be safe and certainly much safer than getting covered second thing when we prevent ourselves from getting coveted we aren't just protecting ourselves because every time somebody gets this disease they become a vector for other people to get this disease so by wearing masks by distancing how and when we can but by taking a vaccine when it's available we are keeping hospital beds free not just for people with covet but also for anybody who is experiencing a medical problem or emergency and that given my track record may very well be me if we only imagine the direct impacts on ourselves right now it will result in more death and suffering and so why would i get a covet vaccine so that i can live my life again without having to worry whether i am going to be the cause of someone else's suffering and finally we all need to do what we can to help frontline healthcare workers right now they are having a year unlike any ever before and these are people who signed up for jobs to help people all of the times when i have gone to the hospital either with a broken bone or for my ulcerative colitis these people have done tremendous kindnesses for me and how we act during this pandemic is in a very real way how we give back to them for the services that they have rendered to us in the past and also will render to us in the future and are giving to all of our neighbors and fellow humans right now so i want to take a covert vaccine for them i'm not gonna get to do it for a little while i'm not first on the list and i shouldn't be but as soon as they tell me i can you best believe i'm gonna be in that line it's understandable to be wary of new things and of big important things like a vaccine for a deadly pandemic and i have health care workers and elderly people and scientists in my life who can help give me the perspective that i have i understand not everybody has that i think i'm lucky to have the perspective to feel like this isn't something that's being done to me it's something that i want to do for myself and for other people john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john in your last video you were talking about how often stories of great accomplishment are told as stories of individual genius rather than like collective progress and i feel like we've talked a lot about this on vlogbrothers i wrote like a couple of books about it forgive me if i've got a lot of thoughts about like why this is the case so i think a lot about teaching and education and one thing that i know for sure is that you cannot know everything and yet we have to understand enough about the world and how it works in order to like live in it and there are a bunch of different things that allow us to do that one of those things is is having access to real information about the world this thing is just about the quantity of information and it is in general what we think of when we think of education sometimes we get so focused on imparting the quantity of information so that you have like all of the necessary data about the world that we have to simplify a lot of stuff and that simplification actually comes at the cost of other parts of what is necessary to sort of like have the tools to live in the world let's have an example when it comes to the invention slash discovery of the smallpox vaccine they're like three things that you should know one smallpox was very bad but we cured it second we did that with a vaccine basically that's very much like the vaccines that we use today that work by exposing people to an attenuated form of the pathogen and third there was a person who figured it out some way and those first two things are facts that are important to have in your head but the third thing is just a story and i think oftentimes we simplify stories to make them good so that we can have like context to hang these important facts we do this a lot in education and i don't think it's a problem simple stories especially good ones that fit into established frames that people are familiar with are really good ways to help people remember stuff but it turns out that the story itself is doing a ton of work in the overall scheme of what education should be doing which is like giving you systems with which to understand and interface with the world and as i said a moment ago you may have forgotten we've been all over the place quantity of like bits of information is only one part of education education also gives us lenses through which to understand the world and those lenses are often stories they also give us shared lenses shared knowledge shared values shared world views all these things help us live together and work together and communicate and so it's super worth asking in what ways individualist stories serve learners and by learners i mean human beings and in what ways they don't i often find myself on the anti-individualist side of this debate but i think that's mostly because like we focus on that so much this does not mean that i think people aren't served by individualist stories i think we are people should understand that to some extent we are responsible for our own faith and that outcomes are definitely dependent on how hard and how much and how smart people work not wholly of course but in part and i think it's also really important to note that like this is more the case for people who have fewer barriers than for people who have more barriers and so individualist stories work a lot better for folks for whom like myself a lot of barriers were really low i also think the focus only on individualist stories can do harm you know in part because a lot of people can't see themselves inside of them and not just in the traditional representation matters way which it does but like also just in the way that many people have barriers that other folks don't have that's something to fight against but it's never going to be something that we are entirely free of and so i think it's important to like have stories that recognize the fact that nobody does anything alone and also nobody contributes not at all like if only through conversations we have with our friends and family everybody adds something to the human story so obviously we should fight against the urge to individualize every accomplishment that happened but also we need to teach people that we are at least to some extent responsible for our own destinies we need to remember that the stories we tell aren't just tools with which to learn things they are the thing we are learning and also we should know that acknowledging or in my case reveling in the fact that nothing is possible without the contribution of millions of people both alive and dead is good that doesn't lessen individual accomplishment it should increase our pride in our ridiculously badass species john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john a few weeks after my second book came out i started working on a new thing and then i stopped working on it i thought to myself you know i don't think i can really write this until after the election because the world is just gonna be so different depending on how that goes so here's the thing as of the recording of this video we don't even know who was elected but regardless i have realized that it is not going to be different in the way that i imagined i thought we were going to have one of two things happen either we were gonna like roundly denounce this thing that is trumpism or we as a country would decide that we accept that this is the right way to be doing things and those two worlds were very different from the world i was living in and very different from each other and so i felt like i couldn't write anything without knowing which of those worlds it was going to take place in but i always tell myself i say this all the time all dichotomies are false dichotomies even that one because there are some true dichotomies and it turns out that uh we may have found a middle path now i'm not saying that this election doesn't matter it matters tremendously and a lot of ways for a lot of people this goes the way i think it will it's a bit of a lifeboat we can't collectively agree that that was the right thing to do if biden is ultimately elected i think that will be seen by a lot of people as a failure of trumpism but it's close enough that donald trump can of course falsely claim that the election was stolen from him and a lot of his followers his supporters will completely lose faith in the american system this rift has been crafted for decades and i think a lot of people who crafted it didn't think or hope that it would get this deep but it has and it was not going to get filled in in one election i had that hope and that was a faulty hope the evening of november 3rd 2020 as florida began to turn red was the first time in my life that it has made sense that donald trump is the president of the united states i spent four years just thinking it was surreal like that guy the reality tv guy with the hair that guy is the president and the way that he talked the way that he behaved it didn't make it any less bizarre because of course it didn't tightly align with how i imagined a president should behave but as the lord it turned red it began to make sense to me that we have a right-wing populist president right now because there are a lot of people in this country who believe that there are people who are not real americans who are making their lives worse what makes them not real americans might be a cultural thing that they're like a coastal elite they're a fancy journalist they're not a real man whatever that is it might be a racial thing that you're not a real american if you're not white or if you weren't born here or if your parents weren't born here it's almost always a politicized oversimplified thing like you're not a real american if you don't support the police and sometimes it's just an authoritarian thing you're not a real american if you don't support donald trump which is a thing that i think some people really do believe we are as individuals and as a nation constantly creating and expressing our values elections highlight that in ways that are sometimes hopeful sometimes really distressing i've been finding it impossible to have any take about this election that i believe for more than 30 minutes before changing my mind except this one it was never going away if texas had flipped it would not have gone away but at least i am glad to have the mirror held up so that we can understand a little bit better what things look like and the work of course goes on regardless john i'll see you on tuesday seriously thanks so much to everybody who was a part of the political process this time it doesn't always feel great but it is vital good morning john four years ago today i was in the hospital very tired and a little anxious and very happy to have a healthy baby boy and a healthy wife who was now a mom while i have pictures and videos and even some audio files of that time they don't tell though a whole story that you can find in another way in some ways a more true story and in some ways a more personal story definitely creepy it's a little mind-blowing but i can go back in time in my google search history and see what i googled on that day and i googled a lot some of it i'm proud of i watched a lot of youtube videos about how to swaddle a newborn baby i also googled the etymology of swaddle because that's a cute word some of the things are a little embarrassing but i get it like i for example oren was like 90 percentile in body weight when he was born but like 50th in in head circumference and that made me super worried no one told me to be worried about this i was worried nonetheless so i googled a ton about this turns out within like three days his head size was normal it was just that his head was really squished because he had gone he'd been burned i think there's some learning i could do from that like the things that i am most worried about when they are most new and i have the least data are often the things least worth worrying about and then there are some things that i'm like oh i have no idea why i googled gay culture otter because apparently i needed to know about that like right then when my son was less than a day old guess the minutes go by and you get bored like somebody everybody else is sleeping and you're wondering about things but there's also a ton of stuff that i do not really know how to feel about because the context here of course is that my son was born in the days leading up to the 2016 election a thing i was very worried about and so there's lots of stuff about donald trump there's also stuff about huma abedin's laptop do you remember this cause like i don't there was something about hillary clinton's assistant's laptop and it felt like a very big story but as with oren's head size it was something that we had very little data on so the story really wasn't the thing it was our anxiety about it and that turned out to be a legitimate thing to be worried about just worried about the worry like with this anxiety about unproven unknown levels of maybe corruption would that lead people to make faulty judgments that we would then have to live with for four years or for ever i want my searches from that day to have all been the cute ones or the useful ones breast milk storage guidelines uh sample birth announcements great how do i know when my baby is done pooping because i'm pretty sure that i thought he was done pooping and i took his diaper off and he wasn't done pooping and then there's just this search one word oren catherine's granddad's name we had not yet named him that and so i was searching baby names and i guess get out me carvine is also fine but i don't want to have been thinking about donald trump on that day but i was and maybe i shouldn't have been but maybe i should have been i didn't know how to be a perfect dad when i'd been doing it for a day i don't even know how to be a good human and i've been doing it for 40 years i don't always know how to engage with a world that has changed so much over the last four years of my child's life i do know that it's better for having him in it and i think it's better for having my worry in it worry for his health and happiness worry for the health and happiness of the rest of us too i think i looked up these google searches because i don't really know how to handle this moment for me this is going to be a rough weekend it might be a rough few weeks but also i know that none of this is going away i'm very worried about this election but it's not going to be the end of the pandemic it's not going to be the end of injustice and inequality not going to be the end of conspiracy theory it's not going to be the end of hyper-partisanship and it's not going to be the end of the fear and the anxiety and the anger that a lot of people experience whether justified or not but at least let's all promise to keep worrying for each other and also occasionally googling the free shivaka do vine john i'll see you on tuesday tuesday good morning john here in the u.s it is 10 days away from our general election it's a big election it's an important election and i would like to encourage everyone to vote right now if you're on the fence about whether to vote or if you know someone who is i'm just going to give you 10 reasons why it's great to vote right now and if you can't vote right now which in some states you have to wait until election day then right now you need to make a plan for when and how you are going to vote on november 3rd number one it tends to be quick and easy now long lines are a problem in some places but 94 of americans will be in and out in less than 30 minutes now that number should be 100 and it's a big deal that it is reporting on long wait times is really important because we have to fix those problems but hearing about long wait times discourages people from voting even in places where wait times are shorter reason number two to vote on every day of the year you are less powerful than bill gates but not in this one way you get the same number of votes as the richest people in america and you get more votes than any of the organizations or corporations that we are always worrying about let me tell you jeff bezos is voting like you know that number three your vote influences the lives of people beyond just you your neighbors but also people all over the world the united states is a very powerful country and we have a responsibility as citizens to engage with that power number four we get really caught up in thinking about one election every four years but there are tons of local elections that matter so much from congress people all the way to mayors and city councilors and school board members now you don't have to vote on everything like if you don't feel like you have a dog in the hunt if you don't feel educated on something you can absolutely leave stuff playing but i live in montana where we have a democratic governor and we have a democratic senator and that would not happen if all the people who are like well trump's gonna win anyway didn't go to the polls reason number five margins matter politicians know that they can get away with more extreme beliefs and actions if they won by like 20 percentage points versus if they won by five reason number six the people who are calling you on the phone to tell you to vote right now actually get a list every day of the people who have already voted and they will stop calling you so that's nice reason number seven the fact that any individual election that you vote in is unlikely to be decided by one vote should only discourage people who want to be the autocrat like do you think that you should be the deciding vote in everything no we are doing this together that's what democracy is reason number eight listen to this lady from boston i want to go to the fenway because we've all been cooked up inside for a little bit and i got my donkeys i'm ready to vote for joe biden but i wish i was voting for bernie sanders but it's a team sport it's a team sport get your donkeys in play reason number nine this election is a big deal it will be and it should be interpreted as a judgment on the way that we've done things for the last four years and that internationally that's how we communicate with each other that's how we treat each other we don't just vote for people we vote for a story and what that story is and what that means for this country what it means for the future of the whole world like that it matters a lot the story of a narrow win is very different from the story of a landslide finally reason number 10 the reason that you should vote right now if you can or make a plan right now if you can is if you don't you might not vote this is just general procrastination advice and stuff that we know if you want to do something you just have to do it you don't like wait for the perfect time or if you are recognize that this is the perfect time if the ballot is sitting on your kitchen table or you're not sure how you're going to get yourself to the polls on november 3rd make that plan now send that ballot now and if you're not sure how any of this works in your state you can go to youtube.com how to vote in every state look up your state the video is less than two minutes long watch it right now john let's do this i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i mean i started out your video yesterday and i was like there's no way this is going to be interesting predicting the future from eight days ago that's just not long enough for this to be an interesting exercise but it turns out it was hugely interesting but before we get too deep here let's see how your predictions went i can be fairly confident that on your today it is unseasonably warm in indianapolis not really it was like three degrees warmer than usual so i'm gonna call this one a mist understandably though it is of course unseasonably warm on most days in most places like you could think of 2020 as one of the warmest years in the last hundred or you could think of it as one of the coolest years in the next hundred the number of newly diagnosed covid cases in the united states was higher yesterday than it was a week earlier probably by around 10 to 12 percent so week-to-week we went from 41 601 new cases to 45791 which is an increase of almost exactly 10 so that's a win for you except it's more of a win for the people who do epidemiological modeling except it's more of a loss for everyone and i can predict about how many people are gonna buy this pizza john shirt today probably around 40. well we blew that one out of the water we sold more than 95 of those shirts which is a great example of how we imagine the future affecting the future which is a thing that happens what happened in afc wimbledon's game against swindon town i think we might eke out a draw john afc woman had a single shot on target during their game with swindon town and it went in the goal and was the only goal scored in the game which means afc woman beat the town and you're now in 10th place i know there's a presidential debate upcoming i suspect that in your present that's being much discussed this was a great prediction john it turns out that because of kovid uh we were going to have a a virtual town hall debate where the two candidates wouldn't be in the same place but donald trump didn't want to do that so he dropped out and then joe biden was like i'm going to do the town hall by myself then donald trump was like okay i'm gonna do a different town hall but at the exact same time why at the exact same time i i don't know maybe because donald trump's favorite debate format is talking at the exact same time as his opponent the whole time i suspect the news of my morning will feel like the very distant past this morning the main news was that the president of the united states has been hospitalized for coving and you are right somehow that is not a big deal in our minds anymore instead the vitally important thing that we're talking about now is how congress is ramming through a supreme court justice instead of i don't know thinking about covet relief maybe and i predict that we will feel like there is cause for alarm and i also predict that there will be cause for alarm john there is and continues to be cause for alarm we also talked in your video about unknown unknowns and how the pandemic was one of those and i disagree with you i think the pandemic was a known unknown a thing that we know could have happened unknown unknowns are things like the fact that mask wearing could be politicized you can look back in hindsight and be like well i could have seen that that would be a thing and like maybe if somebody asked you like could mask wearing be politicized you would have said yeah yeah maybe it could but no one would have thought to ask the question that's an unknown unknown and our lives and our history are governed by unknown unknowns the rise of social media the mere existence of climate change the internal combustion engine at one time all of these things were unknown unknowns and looking at today from eight days ago which is not a long time ago has provided a surprising amount of insight first the thing we're caught up in now isn't the thing we're gonna be caught up in next week which doesn't seem true like it doesn't but it is also there is just a ton about today that we don't know like we like to think that today is the thing that we know the best but no the thing that we know the best is like a year ago and finally just a great deal has happened uh it's helped me realize that a great deal has happened and continues to happen and all of it has been for the species ultimately survivable john i'll see you tomorrow good morning john so writing fiction is hard and weird and i have found that it is a very important thing to identify something about my fictional characters not their star sign it's not whether they're an intp not really what they value it's not really their identity it's like an overlap between those two things i have a hard time articulating it probably because sociologists will roll their eyes at me and be like it's way more complicated than that hank but it is the overlap between the attributes that they think are positive and the attributes that they think they have it's the stuff about them that they think is valuable the reasons why they think they matter and i've also found this to be a useful thing to understand about myself and the people who are important to me and also like people who are important to my society so here's how i kind of feel like this works society is like here are the positive attributes pick a few and have them be yours and maybe you're lucky and a couple of those things fit like a real nice new shirt and then you can feel like you matter other times people will find that there isn't a lot of overlap between the things that they've been told are valuable and the way that they actually are or the opportunities that they've been given and that sucks it doesn't mean that you can't figure out how and why you matter it just means that you kind of have to like figure it out on your own you have to make some things up and have them not be the the default things that society has presented to you here are a few more things that this line of thinking has brought to me the traits that you believe are valuable about yourself are really important to your self-worth and so if somebody threatens that it can feel like an assault and it sometimes happens with attributes that like one person doesn't think is that big of a deal and the other person thinks is like the only reason they matter in the world and that can cause some tension second any given culture will have a lot of strong opinions about which traits are really valuable and it is much easier to go with your culture's beliefs than to try and define it all on your own and third there is good stuff about all of the traits that people value that's why we value them there are however also definitely some worrying things about some of them this has all been ridiculously abstract so far so let's just let's list some traits beauty intelligence ancestry strength wit care kindness wealth selflessness curiosity loyalty grit independence mastery of skill winning focus how well we conform to expectations of social roles like gender family and career being part of groups like teams or citizens or friend groups or political parties and depending on how you're raised the stories you hear the default expectations of your culture the attributes you end up believing in may or may not be attributes that you can actually embody and sometimes they're things that you can only embody for a specific period of your life and then you won't be able to do it anymore as humans we need to believe we matter and so i'm hesitant to say that these things are subjective but they are from my point of view there is no mattering outside of in here it's just the story we find most compelling whether it's the reckless individualism of thomas edison or the thoughtful kindness of a teacher or parent we believe in the stories we find ourselves in sometimes those stories make us miserable sometimes we don't match them sometimes we grow beyond them sometimes the world changes and they become less useful and do more harm than good if i have any wisdom to share here it's that these things are not carved in copper these things can change and they should and that should never make you feel less worthwhile it should make you feel human because of all of the exceptional things about humans the amazing traits that we have the one that is most human is adaptability what matters to you the stories you find yourself in how you imagine your value all of those things can change and all of them will john i'll see you tomorrow pizza mess fanny pack fanny pack it's got a zipper in the front and a zipper in the back fanny pack fanny pack hmm that was a lot good morning john it's pizzamas i have every opportunity to say just about everything about me on the internet so i feel like i've said most of the things but i've searched around and i don't think i've said this i like mosh pits or maybe i used to like mosh fits i i may have gone in my last mosh pit like i know that i'm a huge dork and i wouldn't want anyone to think anything else but flinging myself into unknown turbulent physicality with strangers one of my top 10 sensations of my life and i think there are some misconceptions about them the first being that they are purely anarchistic and that they are violent now you can get hurt in the mosh pit and there are violent people in mosh pits but there are also rules now the rules are going to be different from scene to scene like a death metal mosh pit is very different from a ska punk mosh pit but anyway as an example the pits i was in the first and most important rule if somebody goes down you get them back up again however you can because that's the dangerous moment in a mosh pit when somebody's on the ground you don't punch you don't kick like shoving and pushing are so different from punching and kicking but i was super fascinated with when i was a kid though and this like this era of my life's maybe from like 15 to 25 is who is making these rules and if you think about it enough it becomes this like very clear microcosm for how culture works now there are a lot of inputs here but like in small shows which was where i was at like the person in charge is the the lead singer and if there's like some some violence happening in the pit they can either just let it go or they can say something about it that's a responsibility that is on them as a leader in that moment and from there those cultural norms were then spread throughout the crowd and something that had been a questionable activity beforehand became something that you obviously shouldn't do and that the rest of the crowd would enforce there's a live seven seconds album called scream reel out and you can several times throughout the album hear kevin seconds say like get that guy out of there or hey hey hey you need to calm down seven seconds most wholesome hardcore band ever bands of that arrow would also write songs about the rules which i it's fascinating to me seven seconds has a song called not just boys fun which is about how to make the hardcore scene more inclusive to all genders from 1984 it was 1984 and the ridiculously influential kind of overlooked way before its time banned operation ivy like you listen their big album energy like 50 of the songs are either about how to be a good person generally like healthy body sick mind or about how to be a good member of the gilman street punk scene the crowd is one of their songs out of the following line if we're scared of one another must be scared of ourselves more than just another crowd we need a gathering instead like it's church these people were my first exposure to how to intentionally lead a community now our parents also were good at that for clarity but there's a difference between like a hardcore band and your mom in terms of like how cool they are they were leading their communities they were establishing norms and they were talking about what behaviors were and weren't acceptable the world looks like chaos and yet usually we're all able to stay on our feet in the best situations when we aren't somebody's there to pick you up because bad things happen when people are on the ground and you lift that person back up not just because that's the rules but because that feels so good having someone help you when you really really need it is nice and helping someone else when they really really need it is even better there's music playing john and it's my first video of pizzamas so you know what that means thanks operation ivy this ain't no [ __ ] fashion unity [Music] see you tomorrow good morning john it's pizzamas i have every opportunity to say just about everything about me on the internet so i feel like i've said most of the things but i've searched around and i don't think i've said this i like mosh pits or maybe i used to like mosh fits i i

you really really need it is nice and helping someone else when they really really need it is even better there's music playing john and it's my first video of pizzamas so you know what that means thanks operation ivy this ain't no [ __ ] fashion unity [Music] see you tomorrow good morning john five months five months of using only titles that appear in smash mouth's all-star five months and as of this title not the best one in the history of the channel we have now used all of them every word in the song like it's so good to be done it's so good it feels good it means nothing but regardless we assigned value to it and now i am so i just i'm amazed i'm proud of us we began this stupid idea on april 21st 2020 a moment at which we were all kind of starting to get used to the idea that there was a big deal occurring and that our lives would be changed significantly for a long period of time it has been nice to have the constancy of this meaningless endeavor throughout that somewhat difficult time this isn't just a thing that didn't make sense it made negative sense it made things worse not only because like occasionally the creator of the work that you are sort of memeing on top of will do something dumb but also because like youtube titles matter ask any youtube creator they think about them a lot that's how it's one of the main tools we have for getting people to watch our content and and like giving away that power it makes no sense no one would do that but john we were excited about doing it for two reasons first constraint is inspiring not like every constraint but like adding constraints can actually really like juice up the creative process so while i occasionally hated myself for making this decision also there were moments that were like i can't believe that this is such a good idea and i never would have had that idea without this constraint second and more importantly i think that we both wanted to prove to ourselves something that we like think that we believe but we weren't sure that we believed and that's that we don't want to grow this channel anymore like we've said it to each other we've said it out loud but like it's different than actually like enacting a policy that intentionally limits growth like i like growing stuff but i think it's very important to understand your goals and how your goals inform your strategy right and a lot of times it's the easiest goal to have is to grow to get better crash courses and sideshow like that's what we want we want to reach more people with more stuff so that we can educate more people and have more people be passionate about learning that's the goal there the goal here is not that it's this is about uh creating a community there's a size at which that feels less real this place is a breeding ground for ideas for weirdness for community for change about enabling other things that could be big deals like crash courses and so in a really real way this is more about connection and engagement than it is about size of audience and i think that after a certain size you actually get less of those other things and how do i know that this is really what this channel is about well john we gave up the ability to title our youtube videos one of the main ways we have of reaching audiences so an important metric is over the last five months how far have we fallen not at all no drop no drop that makes no sense it makes it just doesn't that's how i know that this is a different thing that's how i know that this is special this has been a five month long dumb experiment that has actually taught me a lot and has also really inspired me for some new things that i think we can do together regardless of the reasons i enjoyed it i am ecstatic that it's over and remarkably considering how poorly planned this was we have completed the project the video before pizzamas so for the next two weeks starting on monday john and i are going to go back and forth making videos like we did back in 2007 one every weekday can't wait i'm very excited about it and also the titles of those videos are going to just be anything they could be anything that is exciting and terrifying john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i just wanted to let you and everybody know that i'm not making a video today uh we said a thing a while back that like hey you don't have to make a video every day you can have some days that you take off you know like i just looked at my calendar on tuesday i had some time on tuesday to make a video and i was like but i hadn't seen your video yet you hadn't uploaded your video during that time and also like i had like some surprise curveballs that came my way family things and so i wanted to prioritize those things which i think everybody understands that we do and would do and should do and like you don't have to tell me like we support that of course you support that i unders i get that which is one of the things i love about this i think that it is clear that we are not focused right now and haven't for a while on growth like this is a thing that everybody here is doing together even if you just watch and never comment and you're not excite like maybe you're not even excited about pizza miss maybe you're just like coming for i don't know i don't know whatever it is for you you're part of it and i think that like we need to understand that generally about the media that we engage with is just by being there you are part of it i've been thinking a lot about how we don't know what we're signing up for when we sign up for the thing that we end up doing you asked me to do this in 2007 i said yep what a concept and then here we are it's 20 20 the future jet packs actually we now we actually have the iron man suit and the thing that this is would be not this it would either not exist or it would be deeply different if it weren't for the people who engage with it if only just watching not even clicking the like button if only just by clicking on the thing and watching the video it would not be this thing did i have something to do with what it is yeah you did too john but like but we are so lucky that it was possible to make something like this and it's only possible to make something like this because the people who engage with it the people who give us their attention and we need to find things like that to engage with and do it and let it be part of what we are and part of how we figure out how to imagine the world it's so crappy right now and i know that my brain is designed to more heavily weight the bad stuff than the good stuff and so i know that when people are trying to influence me and the rest of the world they're going to focus on the bad stuff and they're going to make me think less of everything in order to get me to not vote or in order to get me to to buy a thing that's going to make me feel better about myself for a moment there's a thing called anchoring bias i think about a lot where you have certain ideas that you go to your go-to ideas and i think it's an impossible thing to avoid and since it's impossible to avoid you have to pick good anchors and one of the things that i anchor to is the idea of negativity bias so i'm using my anchoring bias to anchor to the idea that my negativity bias exists and that just reminds me that the world is probably and people are probably better than i think and that's at least something anyway all that is beside the point i'm just here to tell you that i'm not gonna make a video this week and i know that it's okay that i don't make a video this week even though i have made a video every week on my day for like more than 10 years and so it feels really weird not to okay that's all john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john when we look out at other solar systems in our galaxy the thing that captivates us the most is the potential of finding other earth-like worlds rocky planets inside the habitable zone of their star not too close that the water would boil away not so far away that all the water would be ice but this is more a question of whether we could live there less a question of whether there could be life there but if we're talking conducive to life we've got some problems first the places most conducive to life outside of earth and our solar system are outside of the habitable zone they are enceladus and europa two ice moons of gas giants that both definitely have giant oceans of liquid water beneath their icy surfaces the second problem is that we've actually got two planets in our solar system mars and venus that were probably habitable for a pretty long time one of them mars is in the habitable zone the other venus is not though admittedly now neither of them are great candidates for human habitability mars as you may have noticed is not a verdant ball of life and venus is even worse you could probably live longer on the surface of mars without a space suit then you could live on the surface of venus with one highs on venus are like 900 degrees celsius that's enough to melt lead so it makes a kind of sense that in our search for life in our solar system we focused on mars not because it's the best candidate though it's a fine candidate but because it's just a lot easier to work with but we have over the years noticed some weird things about venus areas of its thick clouds that get dark for some reason that we can't explain for example which has led to people looking for how life might exist there here's the thing if you move away from venus's surface and towards space well they say it gets colder cold enough that steam condenses into droplets of water the temperatures and pressures 40 to 60 kilometers above the surface of venus are like florida except for the part where the water droplets are highly concentrated sulfuric acid venus sucks no life on earth could live in water anything like that acidic but life does sometimes find a way the thought is that maybe some kind of microscopic life could live inside of these water droplets and then as they eventually and inevitably fall toward the surface of venus those droplets evaporate and those cells are then able to enter some kind of dormant spore stage until they get tossed back up into the nice part of the atmosphere again and this is just guessing but it means that maybe it's worth looking looking to see if maybe there are some chemicals in the atmosphere of venus that we can't explain and that's why it was a big deal this week when among the rest of the world being an unforgivable mess scientists announced that they'd found a seemingly impossibly high concentration of phosphine in the atmosphere of venus phosphine is nasty stuff if you're a human but it's okay for some microorganisms they produce it as a waste product specifically bacteria that don't use oxygen in their metabolism and phosphine can't exist in the atmosphere of venus very long there are processes that would break it down pretty immediately so it existing means something is creating it now of course there could be some unknown geochemical process that produces phosphine on venus and if so just figuring that out would be a big deal and there's a phrase that often comes up in the search for life on other planets extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and so if you're going to claim that life exists somewhere else in the solar system we need the big proof which the authors of this paper confirm would need to be an actual visit to the upper atmosphere of venus and i imagine that that mission will happen in my lifetime which is super exciting but i actually don't think it's extraordinary to claim that there is life elsewhere in the universe maybe not even in the solar system look we've never found a way to duplicate the cascade of chemistry into life in the laboratory but it's also definitely a thing that happened and if a thing can happen once it can happen again it can probably happen again a lot so if it happened to happen on one of our next-door neighbors that would be extremely exciting but maybe not as surprising as we might at first think john i'll see you on tuesday gosh it's impossible to not tell you about scishow space at the end of that video if you like this kind of stuff scishow space is the channel where we talk about this twice a week and it's great it's hosted by me and caitlin and reid and it's right here on youtube where you can find it any old time okay bye good morning this video is going to be mostly for citizens of the united states of america i know that's not all of nerdfighteria but we got some important things going on here we live in a country where we decide on stuff together we decide who the president is going to be who the lawmakers are going to be in many cases what the laws are going to be attorney generals attorney generals and judges and sheriffs and ballot initiatives we vote for these things we tend to focus and i'm including myself in this a lot on the president but there are a great number of things on our ballots every time we vote and those things have huge impacts on our country our state and our cities and counties a huge amount of how america gets governed is on the state and local levels and here's the thing that i worry about if you don't think about it before november 3rd you go into the ballot box or you're about to mail in your ballot and you think i haven't really done the research so maybe i just won't and the first thing i'll say to that is you don't have to vote for everything on a ballot this is not a test but the second thing is you gotta vote if you don't go your voice doesn't get heard and your opinions they matter less elected leaders listen to voters more than they listen to the average american this is because voters are the ones who hire them they should be representing all americans equally yes but let's be honest you're going to be more responsive to the people who are doing the hiring and firing so turn yourself into a voter that's how you get served how do you turn yourself into a voter well first thing you got to make sure that you're registered you can go to vote.org and check it takes 15 seconds second if you are registered or you need to get registered you need to learn how all this works in your state and in the u.s elections are administered state by state and so there are different rules for every state which is why we at complexly in partnership with media wise have created how to vote in every state it's a collection of videos it represents every state and also some non-state situations like military overseas or territories and it'll get you straight on everything from absentee voting to sample ballots to getting registered every one of these videos is less than three minutes long and it will give you everything you need to know to create your voting plan and this is the thing when you sit down to watch one of these videos i want you to do it with a pen and a piece of paper and i want you to write down your voting plan everything from what date you're going to be registered by when you're going to need to know who and what you're voting for and how you're going to either get your mail-in ballot or vote early or be at the polls on november 3rd i remember when i was first voting a big question i had because i was in college was do i vote where i am in college or do i vote where i am like my parents house this is an important thing to understand about voting what you vote for depends on where you live and that depends on where you are registered in the situation i was in i could either choose to be registered where i was going to college or at my parents house i chose at my parents house but the address you're registered at determines all of the elections you will be voting in like obviously if i was registered in saint petersburg i wouldn't be voting for the mayor of orlando other things to understand mail and voting absentee voting depends a lot state by state some places everybody can do it without a need to do it other places you have to fulfill requirements early voting also happens at different times in different places and the way that sample ballots are given out also changes from place to place sample ballots are super useful they let you know exactly what's going to be on your ballot you can even fill it out at home and then bring it to the polls with you voting is an opportunity there are lots of places in this world where people don't get to do it it's also a responsibility it's also maybe a little stressful but how to vote in every state has all of the information available to you and it doesn't take a ton of time to get that information in your head they've also made a few other helpful videos like how to do your research how to understand polls how to watch a political ad it's a really great tool i'm really proud that we're a part of it so watch your state and then you can send that to all the other people you know so that they can know how easy it is and important it is to vote three minutes and you're set because i don't want to know what happens if you don't go john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john a couple of weeks ago somebody mentioned me in the comments of this tick tock i was just doing my makeup for work and i just wanted to tell you guys about how i don't think math is real and i know that like it's real because we all like learn it in school or whatever but who came up with this concept and you're like pythagoras but how how did he come up with this how would you even figure that out how would you like start on the concept of algebra i was immediately excited by this because this young woman is asking all of the right questions to not just lead to a greater understanding of math but actually joyous understanding of math and i get frustrated that oftentimes the way we teach math right now ignores these questions how did pythagoras a dude who didn't have a flushable toilet figure out an equation that we still use and is still useful today thousands of years later a truth so true that it is more true than reality is every point in our universe has some bluntness every line has some wiggle but in pythagoras mind there was a perfect triangle one that no matter how far you zoomed in the lines were straight the points were pointing one in which for every right triangle the area of the square made by the hypotenuse was exactly the same as the area of the squares made by the legs of the two triangles added together exactly exactly now there's the question of how he figured this out there's a number of thoughts about this we're not sure the one that's most discussed is that he was looking at a bunch of square tiles and he thought if i split one of those squares diagonally then i get a triangle and the legs of that triangle well the squares made by them are right there the they're those squares there and the square made by the hypotenuse well it's made out of triangles if i split these other squares but if you add those triangles we just made up you get the two leg squares and then he abstracted that not just to triangles made by squares but all kinds of right triangles the point though is that he didn't need any special knowledge to figure this out he didn't need any special technology he just needed to play a game in his mind they say he was like visiting a palace i think he was pooping i think 90 chance he was pooping now the pythagorean theorem is useful information like it comes in handy for people it doesn't come in handy for me that's not why it's interesting it's interesting because it's interesting the idea that we teach people the pythagorean theorem without teaching them that mathematicians build universes in their minds that are more perfect than the one that we live in in some ways that's wild that's wild sometimes it is brought up and sometimes the fact that pythagoras built a cult promising secret knowledge about this stuff and then actually delivered on that secret knowledge that was extremely powerful and wild that you can create a universe in your mind that also is sometimes taught but not always i mean come on this young woman asks does math exist i don't know i don't know did pythagoras discover his theorem or did he invent it does math both exist and not exist is it an artifact of our minds or of reality no one knows the answer to that question well let's let people ask it the most discouraging thing is that of course because as discussed this is an imperfect universe people then like mocked her as if she was stupid when she's asking the question the big question math is a game it's a game we play in our minds and i don't know how we ended up going from like go play go play to like remember this equation this is how we will judge you when we're deciding whether or not you get to go to college so bless this young woman for her questions and bless kind the drag queen for explaining mathematics on tick-tock so i guess this universe does have some things going for it john i'll see you on tuesday also i interviewed bill gates about misinformation and internet platforms over on hank's channel if you want to check that out it's there i liked it good morning john so as you are well aware i've been spending a lot of time on tick tock and this is because i am addicted to tick tock i'd like to be able to say that it's because i am a professional media analyst who needs to be able to participate in trends in order to understand them so that he can continue to do his work and that's actually not untrue this is part of what i do for a living i think it's some of the best parts of my novels and also with our work complexly with scishow and crash course we do need to understand how people are getting information into their brain so that we can get information into their brains but like facebook is also a pretty big player in the media economy and i spend like 15 minutes there a month if you follow me on facebook by the way and you're like no you don't hank you're there all the time no that's just my tweets that get reposted to facebook so yeah i spend time on tick tock because i like it and it's addictive but also i'm aware that like there are problems with the platform like is it more of a security concern than facebook or twitter or instagram considering that twitter just like a month ago had a hack that basically exposed all of the direct messages of all of its users to hackers i'm like it doesn't actually get much worse than that and then obviously it's a platform that is in turmoil the ceo just quit microsoft and walmart are teaming up to try and acquire the us operations of tick tock because otherwise the president might ban it it's just messy it's a messy place and all of this is you know it's a little bit above my pay grade like i'm happy to analyze it and mouth off about it but like i don't know how to run tick tock what isn't above my pay grade though is being a creator like that's a thing i know lots about like like a lot like more than anything else and the fascinating thing about tick tockers is that almost all of them would kind of like to be youtubers or instagrammers if that's what that's called and that's not a surprise to me there's really good reasons to want that and it reminds me of back when we were first making stuff on youtube and all youtubers wanted to be in tv or movies i mean yeah youtubers doing like extremely well still going out for auditions to be like in bit parts and movies or in tv commercials so this is a thing that i learned about dreams we can really only dream the things we've seen before we want to go down the paths our idols walked down but the thing that we forget is that they didn't walk down paths because those paths weren't there yet they created them so when i look at these young people who are extremely talented and working very hard what i think is two things first you have no idea what you're in for and you can never know and you wouldn't listen to me if i tried to tell you and i'd probably be wrong if you did but second you are in the perfect place you are where you are supposed to be is it tumultuous and fragile and do you have no idea what tomorrow will bring yeah yeah yeah and that's too bad but it's also the reason this exists right now it's the reason it can be so weird and vibrant and inspiring and constantly surprising and that doesn't mean you shouldn't be thinking about potentially other paths that don't look like tick tock but probably you shouldn't be looking at the paths that are really well trod and full of people who have lots of power already things are really tumultuous and the clear paths are really full but this situation might mean that there actually are a lot of paths out there that would be really useful and valuable but haven't been blazed yet and that sentence wasn't just about tick-tock it was about 2020. every day i get to wake up and mostly i get to walk some fairly well-trod paths and that's nice i like the comfort of that i like having a direction that i know i should go in so that i can go in it i'm really grateful at this point in my life to have that stability but also i found that i need to at least sometimes go off in directions that aren't clear and that i don't know even where that path is going or through an area where there just is no path i find that i've gotten better at that i also find that that's where i learn the most and often where i feel like i can add the most value especially when i look behind myself and i see the path it's there now and there are lots of people who are finding it a nice one to walk down john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john last year i made a video about how game of thrones can be seen as an allegory for climate change and it included this line climate change is literally the first global scale collective problem our species has ever faced and oh god so that made me think a couple of things one was is it really is it really like cancer is a global scale collective problem kind of so is nuclear proliferation poverty and i guess it depends on what i meant by collective and since i'm me i guess i get to decide that maybe i mean by collective that we all contribute to it and we all can and however small away have an impact either positive or negative on the problem through our actions and through that lens maybe maybe global warming is the first large-scale collective problem the world's ever faced but if that is true then john we've got a second and they could have done without a second there was some talk early on about how covet would be a positive for the environment which i hated from the very beginning a thing that is often overlooked or not talked about enough is that like overcoming climate change is going to require prosperity it requires a world in which there is enough both for people to be safe and happy and also for us to have the resources necessary to like free ourselves from the carbon economy and that's a tall order because a lot of our current happiness and safety and health and prosperity relies on the carbon economy i'm sorry to say it that's the situation right now we are incapable of guaranteeing people's health and happiness without spending extra resources on combating climate change we're sitting here with a global gdp for 2020 at negative five percent that's four trillion dollars and here's a wild thing the un's upper estimate for how much it would cost to fix climate change four trillion dollars per year yes we are incurring the costs of about one half to one coveted epidemic every year we do not tackle climate change we have a very big global collective problem right now and we're spending a tremendous amount of resources either directly or through decreased economic activity on that problem as we should be and none of us know what the end result is going to be but it's not hard to imagine that there will be a fairly significant period of slow or even declining economic growth and while that's happening we won't be focused on climate change which i understand but we also just won't have the same level of resources we otherwise would have had to help free ourselves from the carbon economy but also i am seeing a clearer brighter light being shined on the dangers of all out individualism just as your freedom of expression doesn't always include the ability to not wear a mask in certain places our freedom to live however we want in this world is going to be impinged upon by the reality that living that way is going to long term decrease our ability to live in the world and so yes there will be costs just as there are costs to combating this epidemic they're just much less bad than the cost of not doing anything we've watched over the last six months collective action unlike anything i've ever seen in my lifetime maybe anything ever are there some standout crap faces yes do we know the ultimate impact of their terrible behavior no we don't and we may never but at least i have now seen a large-scale collective action of the kind if not the magnitude necessary to take on climate change and so if i am more fearful because we're headed into a less prosperous world at least for now i am also more hopeful because i have seen that people can and do make sacrifices when we see what's really on the line john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john if your life is anything like mine there's going to be a time in it when you decide to do a thing and at first you love the thing it's an amazing thing the greatness of the thing is so inspiring it fills your tank so much that you hit the ground running and you sprint for weeks maybe months and during that time you never even question its greatness but then maybe a couple of the things that made the idea so great feel a little less great now maybe some of the initial fuel that was fueling you runs out maybe the world changes in totally unnecessary and ridiculously annoying ways that make you feel less enthusiastic about it then you have to decide maybe even once you're like three quarters of the way through the project if you want to keep going like you're still doing it the default state is to just keep doing it and so it's hard to stop but it seems at this point a little onerous like you're not that excited about it anymore maybe you'll say okay let's just let's just stop or maybe you'll say i don't care if this isn't fun anymore i decided to do this thing and i'm ding dong gonna do it and that's not like good that's not stick-to-itiveness that's not perseverance it's stubbornness it's simply saying like world i don't care if you don't want me to do this i don't care if nobody likes it i don't care if it's not a good idea anymore i said i was gonna do this thing and you can burn down around me but i'm going to keep hiking up this hill even though it's hot even though i don't like it even though i'm not sure why i started in the first place or what i'm gonna see when i get up there then even when you're being driven by pure stubbornness and not any kind of relentless fortitude not the hustle that everyone says you need these days but just because you said you were gonna do it then maybe you find something you find something new something interesting something inspiring you learn something about yourself even if you should have given up long ago you find some insight or the world changes again and the idea becomes good and then you'll be like see i did it i was relentless i stuck with it and it was worth it i knew it even though everyone told me to quit except it wasn't your genius it wasn't your relentlessness it was just that you were stubborn and you got lucky because it's just as likely maybe even more so that this sprint that you started out on but the world has been screaming at you saying day after day week after week isn't really working is only going to get more sticky and laborious as time goes on and then the people who are watching you publicly subject yourself to this foolhardy task will shake their heads and say what are they doing what are they doing and the only response that you have the only honest response anyway is i said i was gonna do it i started doing the thing and i can't stop and once i have done it at least i will have done it and that will be something it'll be something what's the right thing to do in a situation like that don't come to me because my answer is do it just do it i just keep going until you're done as long as there is an end date as long as it's in sight keep going even if it makes no sense even if you don't really like it anymore you never know what you're gonna learn out there you never know what you're gonna see and at the end at least you will have done it anyway john this is just something i've been thinking about not really applicable to anything in my life right now but certainly something i've been through before maybe it'll be helpful to you or somebody else watching good news the second episode of bizarre beasts if you're missing that here on vlogbrothers is up on the youtube.com bizarrebeast's youtube channel it's hosted by sarah suda and it's about the watson which is one of my favorite birds also oran's favorite youtube show scishow kids is coming back you can find it now at youtube.com slideshowkids with hundreds of episodes we've already uploaded but new ones will start going live on monday and finally james from journey to the micro cosmos just got a new microscope and it's so beautiful made me cry john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i've noticed that a lot of people who project a lot of confidence are able to do that because they have a lifetime of experience pretending when in fact they have this like deep looming well of insecurity always like just offshore i mean me which makes it really fun to publish a book because books get reviewed it can feel a little like hello i am a stranger and i am now going to tell you whether or not the last two years of your life were worthwhile two stars now the reviews for a beautifully foolish endeavor have been very good but that doesn't mean that i haven't run into some that have made me feel bad so let's start out with two things that i know first critique is not the only way to respond to a piece of media that you consume so sometimes what is in the reviews isn't a critique it's just i liked this or i didn't like this sometimes it's just it made me think about these things or it reminded me of this other book and that's great until and unless the author takes it as a critique which it's not meant to be and the second thing that i know is that responding to critique is a skill that must be learned it is something that we are all going to deal with in one way or another in our lives and it's something that you are not immediately good at it is normal to be bad at it so here are some tips from a confident looking guy for how to handle criticism and turn it from a thing that is all bad to a thing that is at least partly good and we're gonna do that by talking about what i think are the four types of criticism first there are things that you know are wrong at least to you like they might be right in how they're experiencing the world but like for you no like sometimes people criticize vlogbrothers videos for using jump cuts and i'm like okay no like we're not gonna stop that and i saw a review of my book today that said that the end wasn't exciting for them and i just like i think of the scenes in the end of the book and i'm like no that's like i disagree and if we disagree then we disagree and i'm not gonna try to like convince them that's how they experienced the work now number two there are thoughts that might be right or are right and these are of course much harder to read but also they're the useful critiques it is really important in all parts of our lives that we understand our weaknesses so that we can work around them or so that we can strengthen them if i feel like i'm not doing something well i look for examples of people who are i examine the tools people are using to do things i have not yet learned to do and that's great and this is how growth happens now it is really important to be able to tell the difference between category one things and category two things it's also really hard and the only way i've gotten better at that is by thoughtfully creating stuff and thoughtfully engaging with critique third kind of critique people just being me if people are in it just to find bad things about a work i like to realize that as soon as i can and just discard it because it seems to me clearly to be not about the work it's about something else it hurts it will never not hurt but it's about something else a lot of times i think it's just people putting the l on the forehead and calling you a loser and like there's nothing to learn from that and last and i put this in a separate category though maybe it doesn't need to be our thoughts about the overall impact a work has on people and on society this kind of critique has become a lot more common lately and i think for good reason we'll get to work and ask if it reinforces stereotypes or indulges in harmful tropes or whether it makes people feel good about themselves or bad about themselves this is the stuff that it hurts worst to get wrong because you kind of can't undo it and like the damage is there and done now some people i think feel like this isn't true critique because it isn't engaging in the craft it's talking about the impact but i think craft is ultimately all about impact it's about using tools to have an effect so critiquing craft for me ultimately is about critiquing effect and thus i think this is stuff that should be enthusiastically discussed so people can get better at because here's what i'm always trying to remember when i'm internalizing criticism whether it's from a friend or a random goodreads review i can either feel like this person is telling me i shouldn't be doing or have done the thing that i did or i can take it as literally the only way that i will ever know how to get better it's not easy it's not simple but in the right light it's a gift john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i'm actually really worried right now and that's not a surprise i have a specific worry though that i'd like to talk about in this video uh regarding the higher education system in the u.s colleges and universities they're just extremely important right vital but here are three true things first schools have been raising prices faster than inflation for over 40 years now if it had over the course of my lifetime increased with inflation the cost of four years of school after financial aid would be about 40 000 now that's a lot and it's an average so there would be schools that would be way above that in schools that would be below that instead it is now over 90 000 and so almost definitionally every year college gets less worth it thing number two it's going to be less valuable if it's an all online experience and yet schools are not like lowering prices and finally there is an increasingly large number of people in this country who actually think that college is bad for america in fact in 2016 a year in which some other shifts occurred in america the percentage of republicans who believe that college has a negative effect on the country went from 37 to 58 and that isn't just an opinion the trump administration is doing things to hurt universities making it harder for international students to stay in the country having the treasury department investigate whether or not non-profit universities should have their tax-exempt status revoked and these are big deals 23 percent of the money that comes into the u.s higher education system comes from international students who are often the only ones who pay full price so international students very clearly subsidize the education of americans so while at first this looks like another anti-immigrant thing it's actually both an anti-immigrant thing and an anti-education thing now it's really hard and complicated to get to the roots of where this antagonism between some people in america and the higher education system comes from it's hard it's historical it's convoluted this isn't simple but part of it and definitely not the whole thing because the whole thing is much more sinister is that colleges are elitist they want to be elite institutions for elite students that's that's how they'd like to pitch themselves and that's how we found ourselves in a world where the number one metric for how good a school is is how many students it rejects this is under examined and pretty gross and it's to the point where schools will actually encourage students who they know they are going to reject to apply in order to keep their acceptance rates low so we cannot say that to some extent this system hasn't contributed to this problem so again higher education is the victim of three things right now decades of this hubris where they think they can just keep raising prices to compete with each other a pandemic that's going to decrease the value of education and an administration that doesn't care we have to fix all of those problems and they are all hard some of them for good reasons some of them i am shocked by how difficult they are but here's the reason i have hope because if this is survivable and i think that it is we will survive it by coming to terms with the fact that higher education has created a tremendous amount of good while also allowing their budgets to get way out of control in order to compete with each other like businesses fighting for customers instead of schools educating students the cost of higher education needs to not just stop going up it needs to start coming down this is our chance to figure out how to do that and it's something we think about every day at complexly where our goal is to create free educational materials that make teaching cheaper and easier but also with bigger ideas like our partnership with arizona state university but the thing to know here is that right now we are at the very beginning of a change in how higher education works a change that needs to be done thoughtfully and carefully despite the fact that we have no choice but for it to happen quite quickly and that's gonna be hard and that is why i'm worried and i just wanted to articulate that john i'll see you on tuesday good morning john i feel like probably we could all use a little change of pace so i'm just going to sit in my yard which has turned out quite lovely this year with just lots of plants and i just want to be in the plants and i'm taking a huge from you because question tuesday sounded good to me sounded simple sounded like something i can do joseph wants to know what my favorite pelican species is the brown pelican i know you're thinking white pelicans are much more majestic and there's a dalmatian palette there's lots of different kinds of pelicans but brown pelicans have the closest to my heart and they seem very nice they just seem like nice birds i didn't expect there to be leaf blowing i thought bird song would happen i thought you know this tree would touch me in the head the whole time i didn't expect yard work at nine o'clock at night and yes this is what it looks like at nine o'clock at night in montana penguicorn says how are you not constantly talking about your book i'm reading it and unable to not keep talking about it that's great and i love talking about my book i mean i said i loved you but this is a little much now i love talking about my book and i love hearing people talk about my book and i spend a lot of time reading the things that people are saying about my book that is a fun little bird noise what are you swallows my neighbor's windows open and he can song to listen to recently think about things by daddy freyr i know i'm not pronouncing that right that's all that's the only one it's so good april wants to know if i could spare some change for gas money uh absolutely just let me know your venmo sarah wants to know why pelicans they're just really good birds in general i've been on a bird kick lately thanks to jason ward mostly you should check out his show and i just love it they're just good and pelicans are maybe the best of them is that controversial probably entirely subjective definitely but i love them look at them look at this one look at this one this one this one how is that not your favorite bird rachel just was diagnosed with adhd and a lot of things are clicking into place advice gosh you guys 9 15. biggest piece of advice is just because your brain works different doesn't mean that it works worse also watch how to adhd great channel different cat wants to know who did you play when you did rocky horror shows i've tried numerous times to find out well maybe i should just like go ahead and show the photo it was all worth it wasn't it i was rocky if you didn't know what that means rachel wants to know what my favorite microorganism is i'm gonna go with lacro maria but that's just today who knows how i'll feel tomorrow i don't think we've done a microcosmos just on lacro mario yet we talk about them a lot in the predation episodes because they're great at eating the stuff but i think we're going to do a specific lacrimaria episode soon and finally laura asks this question it's getting dark out and likewise she says these are dark days so how do you lift your head to the light when the darkness is so heavy oh my laura i make things with people i love when i have the opportunity to do that i also look at birds and i think that that's really important and i i try and let my curiosity lead me to interesting places because finding stuff out and this is just for me is one of the only like completely undependent on the rest of the world things that brings me satisfaction and joy that and of course other people and my relationships and i think that finding strength in community and love that's the thing that's carrying me through so i hope that there are opportunities for that for you as well john thank you for being a part of that of that curiosity of that making stuff and of that love and i will see you not this tuesday but next tuesday because you're taking tuesday off oh my god a mosquito oh geez i'm really gotta go inside now i hope my neighbors understand that this is what i do good morning John as you may have heard there's a lot of content in the world now what I do sort of fancy myself a understander of media and I think that's a really like important thing because it's how we understand the world like those stories that we are told the stories we believe that we share the ideas that move around inside and through people and onto others that's what humanity is so care about that a lot I care about it enough that when there's a new way that that's happening a lot I almost feel an obligation to engage with it I can't always do that but I've been doing it with tik-tok and I will say upfront don't download tik-tok just to follow me it's a addictive platform for sure it's gathers a tremendous amount of data about you once that data is out there it is very difficult to imagine what it might be used for in the future even though the platform doesn't want to use it for something bad we see that that information can be compromised but I have this theory that we now live in a world with functionally infinite content that doesn't mean that all of the content that should be made is getting made and it doesn't mean that all of the audience's that should be served are getting served we need to be aware that the platform's through which we consume content really heavily affect what kind of content gets created there's this whole idea in Media Studies Marshall McLuhan's the medium is the message the ways in which content is distributed and discovered influences what the content itself becomes in a way that is so profound that the medium itself is kind of the content like we needed to make 22 minute long pieces of content for American television so we could have eight minutes of ads every half hour on this situation comedy defined itself around that constraint and now we live in a world where the medium instead of being television or radio is the platform it's the algorithm those things so deeply control what kind of content gets made and for whom because another really important part of the medium being the message is that content doesn't get created for every one part of the medium and legacy media is the people making the decisions about what content is going to be created they get to decide humans not very many if we don't have that as much but we definitely have the fact that advertisers will pay more for some audiences than for other this idea that I often sort of use as a touchstone that there is infinite content and we sort of have to prepare for that world isn't really true there are still all of these constraints out there and those constraints are different for different media and they're different for different people creating different things for different audiences but in the time I've spent on tick tock I've never felt more like we are getting closer to that infinite content world because the constraints on creation have been lowered the constraints on discovery have been lower like the story of quarantine has been tick tock being like cow and kwibi which is a thing rose like billions of dollars in trying like interface with the best most talented creators in the world here's another one of my anchors Florence Italy during the height of the Renaissance when Machiavelli and da Vinci and Michelangelo we're all working that sound out about the same number of people as Missoula Montana it is not a lack of talent that holds us back it is a lack of access I'm not saying that tick tock is the Renaissance but the talent of the creativity is kind of astounding to the point where I just don't feel like I could ever find all of the good stuff and that's not a new feeling I feel that way about television I feel that way about books this has something of a fracturing effect on society where we consume very different kinds of content and we don't have as many touchstones in common with each other but it also means that people who didn't have access to that career didn't have access to any influence at all now get some access to that and so when we have that sort of like off-the-cuff observation that like I can't consume all of the good content anymore I think that that actually has some really deep societal implications that are really worth examining John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John I've spent this week doing basically nothing but talking about my new book which I have to be honest love cuz I spent two years writing it and not being able to talk about it and I've had lots of things to say and one thing that I keep getting to talk about he's idea in part because like there's a lot of weird surprising things that happen in the book and people like where do you get your ideas in part because the characters in the book talk about ideas and where ideas come from and how they come to ideas and this is an idea that I'm fascinated with and have been for a very long time as someone who kind of has to come up with an idea for a video every week it also as a person because like where ideas come from is really important because almost everything is an idea like justice is an idea and an evolving idea America is an idea money is an idea borders are ideas political parties and businesses are ideas this is your doesn't have any spoilers in it but there are two characters that are having sort of a different take on where ideas come from one of them is struggling a lot with feeling like he can't come up with any actually original ideas and all he does is like grab on to stuff from around him and synthesize it into something slightly new or just his own take on an existing idea well the other character has like a system that really works for her and that's take a good robust strong understanding of the problem that you're trying to solve and a carefully selected problem and second all of the tools that you have access to and then you just sort of like put them in your brain bucket and shake them around and something falls out and if that doesn't work then you either have to change what problem you're looking at or the scope of the problem or you have to modify your toolkit but here's the thing and this isn't talked about in the book those are actually the same thing that first character what he's doing is not identifying his core problem but he's doing the second thing where he's trying to modify his toolkit to see what falls out and really his problem is that he's supposed to have interesting stuff to say like suddenly it is his job to have good and interesting takes I had an interviewer asked me yesterday if I thought that there were actually ever any new ideas or if we're in this like weird sad were where everything is just a slight tweak to something else and I was like yeah yes but there are new ideas every new idea though is contingent upon all of the old ideas there's a saying I think that Newton said it if I if I thought of anything original it was because I was standing on the shoulders of giants something like that I'm paraphrasing I shouldn't paraphrase I should look at it turns out it's older than Newton but Newton did have his own take on it his own tweak to this this is great if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants but here's the thing while that is very complimentary we are not standing on the shoulders of giants we are standing on the shoulders of each other of normal-sized people both of these books talk a lot about music and that is not an accident because music for me is the best example in the clearest example of how every creation is a collaboration with the past ideas are deeply dependent on our toolkits and our toolkits didn't come from nowhere and that's everything from how we imagine the world the stories we tell about ourselves in our society and also the things that we actually know about the universe and the skills and talents that we've taken the time to develop and so when people ask me where ideas come from it's from there it's from building on the work of billions of other people over hundreds of thousands of years and I cannot imagine thinking that that makes this less amazing it only makes it more amazing to me John I'll see you on Tuesday Good morning John. A very long time ago I bought this. This is called a softbox it's a light that photographers and videographers use to make nice, soft diffused light. I got this about 10 years ago and I have used it in every vlogbrothers video I filmed at home since then. Until today, because the bulbs in this thing over the years have started to go kaput. And yes these are the original 10 year old bulbs. One of these bulbs burned out doesn't turn on anymore, which is a thing that happens. Once, the light fell over and one of the bulbs broke so that's where one of them is. So I had three working bulbs and that was enough I guess and then a couple of weeks ago I was filming and then I left my office and then I came back in and there was smoke in here! Light bulbs are totally supposed to burn out. They're not supposed to catch on fire! So the base of one of the bulbs was a little bit on fire. I took the bulb out, it hadn't broken it was just sparking internally and I ordered some new lights and then I didn't set them up because, like who's got time for these things? Well yesterday another one of the bulbs caught on fire! Over 10 years of using these lights and two of them catch on fire within two weeks of each other. Something must have gone wrong with the electricity, it must not be the bulbs-- it's something else has broken with this light. In any case you're now watching a video that is filmed with an LED light. It's a little bit harsh right now but I think that I can use another one and turn them both down and that'll look a little nicer so let's see how that looks. You know they say three-point lighting is  best but two is gonna have to do! John, A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor comes  out in four days. I'm very excited, very nervous it has had really good reviews so far so that has taken some of the weight off but the point is while my world was actually literally a little bit on fire it's so also figuratively so--  I guess I'll just run this video out with like things you maybe should know one if you read the first book but it was a while ago and you've kind of forgotten I released a recap video voiced by Kristen Sieh, the audiobook narrator over on Hank's channel. You definitely should not watch that video if you don't want to be spoiled on the first book though. The audiobook cast has been announced and there's a bunch of people on it the reason why is that there's five point-of-view characters then there are also what are called epigraphs. These are like bits of context that happen between chapters. So this is a partial transcript of a closed-door fundraiser in Decatur Georgia, with Senator William Casey, a made up person. And those bits are sometimes things that need their own voice actor to differentiate them from the rest of the text. I like to think about audio as a different medium and how we can adjust it to best serve the the needs of that medium. So we thought about that a lot I'm really proud of what we came up with there's also a book resource guide at https://altusfuture.net. It's got a book club kit it's got character playlists, it's got zoom backgrounds, all kinds of fun stuff. And the virtual book tour is still happening, which you can learn more about a hankgreen.com. If you bought a ticket for the July 6th event that John and I are doing together your ticket may have been refunded and you have to buy it again. That's a complicated thing that I'm sorry about. So check your inbox for an email from The Strand which is the bookstore that we're doing it with to make sure that you're still signed up. John I'm gonna be honest with you this has been a really obviously stressful time of my life, but strangely I'm not experiencing that much book stress. I'm really excited for this thing to get out in the world. I really appreciate all the the feedback I've gotten from you that's been really positive and from early readers. I was able to do podcast sponsorships with a bunch of small and dependent podcasts for the book, and I've gotten to be on a bunch of podcasts! I recorded a couple today, I'm recording one tomorrow. if you listen to podcasts it might be hard to miss me. It really has been fun it's been a lot and there's a lot else going on at the same time but I kind of set myself up for that kind of situation. Why do I do that is a story for another video. And I just noticed on my floor of my office which is extremely filthy these are the actual last sheets of the book that I did my edits on the most common note when I'm editing myself is the word loose. Loose. I don't know what I even mean by that but you don't want it to be loose! Alright John, well I will see you on Tuesday, day that a Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is officially on sale. good morning John it was a year ago that I decided that I wanted to do a full year where every month I made a video about a different weird animal here on the vlog with this channel for every one of those weird animals we'd make a pin people would be able to sign up and get those pins as I made the videos and we call it the bizarre beasts pin Club and this is the twelfth one of those I really loved this little project inside a project and we conclude with an animal that is not an animal so John do you remember the time when we were kids at the beach and there was a dead Portuguese man-of-war and I stepped on it and I was in Paden for a full day well because of that I have kind of always assumed that these animals were fairly well understood as they are common they impact people and they are weird enough that we probably would have spent lots of time looking and our lack of understanding of Portuguese man-of-war isn't really down to a lack of curiosity it's down to a lack of sense it is very confusing a Portuguese Man O'War for example is not an animal it is for animals this is upsetting what do you mean Hank somehow for genetically distinct animals with their own nervous systems have combined together to create a single colonial organism one of them is the stomach one of them is the gonads one of them is the floaty part and one of them is the tentacle part basically there's there's overlap how much overlap we don't know how does that overlap function how does an animal exist with four different nervous systems and how do those nervous systems communicate with each other we don't know this is not how it's supposed to work but life isn't supposed to work in any particular way it's supposed to work in the way that works in the Portuguese man-of-war as a colonial siphonophore works even if while researching this video it forced me to read sentences like as the organism grows in the nomada sakkath expands interior Lee Newton tacular pal ponds grow at the base of the original gastro Zoids and these animals are beautiful well okay sorry these colonial organisms are beautiful they're also kind of terrible of course they're predators they send out their stinging tentacles up to a hundred and sixty-five feet some fish however have evolved to be able to carefully avoid those tentacles or have some imperviousness to them which allows them to you the tentacles of the Portuguese Man O'War as shelter from larger predator fish and one species of fish actually is figured out how to live there and feed on the Portuguese Man O'War these organisms are named for the sailing ships that they very roughly resemble and they do sail the floaty bit has a sail on the end of it and that's designed to have the wind push the Manowar so that its tentacles stretch out behind it otherwise the Manowar would have to swim away from its tentacles wasting energy they're so good at catching fish that large colonies can actually deplete fisheries and the gas inside of their little bubbles 14% carbon monoxide so that also could kill you though you would have to cut it open and breathe it in a lot which would be it's questionable questionable decision-making the variety of ways that evolution has figured out how to have an organism survive actually does astound me it really does this has been such a fun project and I've enjoyed so much getting a new pin in my mailbox every month along with it and I've also felt kind of limited by the for a minute time limit of vlogbrothers because like there's a lot to say about these animals so so I'm not ending it and I would like to announce youtube.com / bizarre beasts a new youtube channel that you can go subscribe to right now know the thing that I love to do and I want you to follow me over to bizarre beasts where I'll be co-hosting with Sarah sudo one episode about a weird animal every month and we will be continuing the pin Club as well and opening subscriptions to more people right now if you want to sign up think that I can have the link to the pin club and the channel and the trailer all right here John I'll see you on Tuesday 10 tacular pal bonds good morning John our planet crashes through on average around 50 tons of stuff a day space is pretty empty but earth is pretty big and it doesn't take much to create a visible shooting star the little Fleck of sky that you see winking down at you is probably no bigger than a grain of sand that's almost everything we run into Little Rock's that got flung off comets or remnants from collisions of various bodies in the solar system a thing that's hard to remember about the earth is that its rocky surface is mostly very young geologically speaking tectonic activity constantly eats up and replaces the surface of the planet so the average rock you might pick up outside probably won't be much older than 2 billion years old and there's a really good chance it's younger than dinosaurs but the little specks of dust and metal that we run into every day nearly all of them are older than the oldest rock on earth that's not precisely true though because there are lots of rocks on earth that are not from Earth they've recently fallen here and the oldest particles on earth are embedded in a meteorite and those particles are over 7 billion years old for context that's about two billion years older than the Sun what percentage of those bits of dust that we run into every day are that old I don't know I don't think anyone does we don't get to learn about them because they get zapped up by the atmosphere we just get to watch them sometimes to find out about space we have to go to it but in a form of shooting stars it can come to us indeed 0.2% of meteorites those are meteoroids that actually land on earth are from the Moon or Mars when those bodies themselves get hit by big meteorites it throws up a bunch of dust and rocks that can eventually make their way all the way here they're probably also bits of Venus and Mercury that have landed on earth but we've never found one and yes some of the shooting stars that we have run into are probably bits of earth that were thrown up millions of years ago by massive collisions in fact Apollo 14 seems to have brought a rock back from the moon that is actually from Earth it might in fact be the oldest earth rock since it was flung there more than four billion years ago anyway I just wanted to look at some shooting stars today just the little ones the regular ones not big fireballs or meteorites not the newsworthy ones just tiny bits of ancient dust from comets or asteroids or planets zipping into the thin but dense blanket of our atmosphere hitting it so hard and fast that they heat up until they and the gases around them visibly glow and they're billions of years of existence becomes just another little beauty for us to be grateful for John my author copies RN physical copy with the actual words that are gonna be in the book in the book oh really nice together as well you can see that this one is a little longer that's not by design there was just a lot of story to tell it also just got its first review from the Library Journal they say not this adventurous witty and compelling novel Greene delivers sharp social commentary on the power of social media and both the benefits and horrendous consequences that follow when we give too much of ourselves to technology it's fair I'm super excited and also pretty nervous hence the watching shooting stars video thank you by the way to Thomas Lindemann who let me use all of his footage that he takes of shooting stars link to his channel in the description where there will also be information about the digital book tour we're doing and how to pre-order the book John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning john australia is a pretty isolated place geographically but then isolated significantly from australia we have the islands of new zealand but then we go deeper and there are a number of islands isolated off the north coast of the south island of new zealand and all the way at the tip of them that's where we find takapurewa or stevens island isolated from the isolated a kind of ecological experiment that the earth accidentally designed takapurewa is home to a number of different very weird species including this weevil that makes no sense what might be the rarest frog in the world literally millions of seabirds something called the darkling beetle and of course it is a stronghold of tuatara but the weirdest of them in my opinion is the one that no longer exists lyle's wren was a weird bird it was a passerine the largest order of birds more than half of all bird species are passings you can distinguish them from other birds because they have three toes in the front and one in the back good for grabbing onto sticks and perching but it was unlike any still-existing passerine because it could not fly like the whole point of being a little bird is flying right lyle's wren basically filled the ecological niche of a small rodent because there were no small rodents on new zealand it ran around really fast and had lots of babies and ate insects and worms and fruits and stuff but if you're gonna be a mouse you're gonna be worse at it if you only have two legs and so when polynesian rats were introduced to new zealand by the maori they both out-competed and just consumed lyle's wrench but polynesian rats never got to takapura but then cat now there's an urban legend that lyle's wren was actually extincted by one single cat this isn't exactly what happened we're not 100 sure how cats got to the island we think probably the lighthouse keepers brought them there because they were lonely but at some point a cat or several cats arrived at the island and the name assigned to the cat that in the urban legend killed off the lyles ran was tibbles and i really like that name i don't know where it came from it may very well have been david lyle's cast so let's just say that david lyle one of the lighthouse keepers had a relationship that was deep enough with a cat that sometimes that cat brought him presents as cats do and one time that present was a dead bird that was unknown to science and that is how lyle got credit for discovering lyles wren it should be called tibbles as ren thank you very much it should actually be called tibbles a camphisitid because it's not even a wren by the time tibbles showed up with that bird there was already a large and thriving population of feral cats on the island the space between lyle being given that gift and the probable extinction of the species was barely more than a year extinction sucks but the good news is that there are now no longer any cats on takapura there aren't even any people there anymore the lighthouse is operated remotely and the only reason people go there is to study this marvelous natural experiment that earth created for us that experiment goes on one bird down for sure and with a lot of ecological degradation but it goes on and with a marvelous ecology nonetheless john is now 25 days left until july 7th when the carl saga concludes and a beautifully foolish endeavor is released which means i have some things to talk about first you can pre-order signed editions of a beautifully foolish endeavor all over the place including now at waterstones in the uk second i'm doing a penguin world's book club event for the first book an absolutely remarkable thing with cat valenti who is amazing third john you and i are going to be doing a launch event on july 7th at 7 00 p.m eastern that will be here that will be available to everyone we're gonna have a good old time fourth there will be a book tour it will be all digital bright side that means everyone can come stick it at events include july 6th with john july 8th with ashley ford july

signed copy of the book in the mail the first 500 people who sign up at each place get a lapel pin that you cannot get any other way it's gonna be fun and weird and you can find out more information at the links in the description john i'll see you on tuesday good morning John there comes a time in every top creators career when somebody comes by with a really big check and says wow you've built an amazing community on this platform we'd like you to move it to a different platform I fancy myself something of a creator advocate so I am in favor of people getting paid I just think people should know for sure what they're getting paid for and there are lots of different things that you might be being paid for in situations like this the old-school version of this which is kind of where it all came from is that a star builds up a career and over time audiences gain an affinity for that star they know what to expect from that star and they will go see a movie largely because that star is in it first year of Andy and Parks and Rec that goes well then you get all buff and you become Peter quill and then it continues to snowball and now you're the leading guy in Jurassic world things are going well this is I guess fine like it feels like it kind of crowds out other people who might be playing those roles but it's functionally how things were and ultimately Chris Pratt and the movie studios and the audiences are all doing the things they want to do people are looking for a movie to go watch in a familiar face is a nice door into that movie but what if you're trying to bring people somewhere they're not used to going well this is why Jeffrey Katzenberg and companies spent over a billion dollars on content for kwibi a new platform that provides quick bytes of video that you can watch in less than 10 minutes thus solving a problem that absolutely no one on earth has and also one that misunderstands the power of celebrity when deciding what movie to go see a celebrity might inform that decision they're not gonna follow a celebrity to a new platform because people don't actually care very much about celebrities I don't think that this is necessarily bad though like I'm in favor of billionaires spending their money and it doesn't seem like it's hurting anyone and heck maybe I'm wrong and it's gonna be successful but the thing that I'm more interested in more thoughtful about it and more ambivalent about is when creators have really deep relationships with their audiences and they have existing projects and products that they then move the entire thing to a new platform and get paid to do that so they're doing it not because it provides a better service or a better experience for their audience but because they're being paid to do it this isn't about celebrity lending their fame to a new project it's saying like I've built an audience I have built a community and you need people on your platform and so I will sell you my audience like in this case you are selling those people and that like you need to be really careful in Jake getting paid to move to mixer is about his audience it's about changing user behavior it's about buying market share with money which is something that Microsoft has plenty of and then also hopefully eventually drawing other smaller creators to that platform where a new audience is growing and those creators will not be compensated for that switch Spotify putting Joe Rogan in the last podcast on the left under exclusive licenses this worries me more because in the case of twitch versus mixer it's Amazon versus Microsoft right like let them fight it out but with podcasts you're taking content out of an open ecosystem that no one controls and putting it inside a closed ecosystem that is owned by a company so Spotify is not paying to compete with another corporation they're paying to compete with an open standard of the internet which podcasting somehow despite all the odds has so far held on to I want to be clear that these situations aren't always bad and that yeah sometimes creators gotta get paid but always as creators and as audiences let's be honest about what's being sold what are the pieces here the talent the fame the influence the audience the power all of that stuff has value whether or not it gets sold and it's up to each individual creator to decide what to do with that value for some people it's writing books and making tic TOCs Sean I'll see you on Tuesday I can't believe you made a tick-tock and also you can't believe you have way more followers than me already good morning John songwriting is amazing getting meaning into an aesthetically pleasing structure is a really interesting challenge and one that creates a lot of beauty in the world but this video is not about those times it is about the worst moments in top-40 songwriting I get that this is extremely subjective but what I'm thinking about when I'm talking about bad songwriting is when like aesthetics is deeply sacrificed for meaning or meaning is sacrificed for aesthetic the most clear example of that second thing being LFO summer girls right this song has a preamble let us listen to it you're saying this song is gonna be about the summer we met okay excellent you are describing the summer in question and these huge makes pieces well it just happened we are suddenly no longer talking about this summer we are not talking about a man's currently somewhat racist stomach not upset that sick and Hits is kind of a forced rhyme that's fine but if you're gonna make a stretch make a stretch for a reason especially in the first line of the song an example of a bad line being less intrusive because emphasis isn't placed on it is the meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture yes this is a forced rhyme that doesn't seem to understand climate science at all that is inside of a verse that essentially could be summed up by saying it's cold no wait it's hot it's not great but it's not emphasized so you don't really notice it doesn't change the feeling of the song as opposed to Eminem undoubtedly has a mastery of language and rhyme and storytelling and meter and I do not understand how his brain works but I also do not understand how you do this okay now you want to leave out the window guess that's why they call it window pane it just landed existed in the middle of the verse it would have been a throwaway little fun pun but because it ends and there's this huge space it like places so much emphasis on this terrible pun which would be okay if the song were not a deeply troubling exploration of domestic violence it's not the worst though we're still gonna get there though it does hurt a little extra because it's Eminem and I do not like the way it hurts what about then when a song sacrifices aesthetics for meaning listen events wait do it again the worst thing is that we've wrapped around to another line which is okay if there's a reason but there's no reason just leave the word book out I get that it's a page in a bow and up page it your history book but the worst line we have arrived is not one that sacrifices aesthetics for a meaning or meaning for aesthetics it's one that just does not even doesn't even try to do either [Music] smoking funny things I will allow but trying different things why why that means nothing did you try a Boca burger for the first time kid Rockne it's not like other things don't rhyme with things where we listening to the songs that Skynyrd sings were you feeling like Kings did Red Bull give you wings was it something about the joy that summer brings trying different things double rhyming is an aesthetic sacrifice and in this case it happens for no reason it's the worst thing I've ever heard done I'm a little warm to go outside I'll see you on Tuesday where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama love the skies are so blue like it's the equivalent of that you want to buy a book by this guy it's available July 7th for pre-order now including a book shop tour where the price is the same as it is on Amazon but you get to support local book shops I'm fine good morning John so let's start with a thing that's pretty good about the world there is a website called Snopes that got started specifically because the internet is bad at getting its story straight and Snopes has been around for ages letting us reply with a simple URL when our aunt's sent us pictures of marbled forks to let them know that yeah a marbled fork isn't a thing in fact Snopes has an entire creature section and usually it is pretty obvious that like the sea Roach is an animatronic from Pacific Rim or that this purple dragon lizard is definitely fake but other times it gets a little messy this for example isn't a picture of a hammerhead salamander because hammerhead salamanders don't exist but they did exist 250 million years ago and that was a sculpture of what they probably looked like which is in many ways just as weird and while the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird this is not a picture of it this is a miniature figurine of a chickadee here but for my money the more interesting thing is when Snopes has a page for an animal not because someone made it up but because no one believes it's real this is unsurprisingly the case for the Shoebill stork and the Malabar giant squirrel but in my humble opinion the most bizarre of the Snopes creatures that are actually real is the hammer-headed bat a mega bat and yes that is the technical term that isn't just real it's downright common in West and Central Africa now the term is mega bat but to be a bat you can't be that big because you have to fly and you don't have feathers and feathers are much better at the flying thing than thin membranes of skin and so generally when you see a bat that is very big it's not as big as it looks it's usually a strange camera angle bats are good at being lightweight so while they can have wing spans of over a meter there is no bat on earth heavier than three and a half pounds a hammer-headed bat tops out at around one pound which is even big for a mega bat most of which are smaller than that but look those are all big four bats the most common bat in North America for example weighs around a third of an ounce but none of this is the thing that astounds you about the hammer-headed bat right like the thing that you're looking at is the head like it's looking kind of dumb now this certainly isn't the only weird-looking bat their faces often look pretty silly but usually that is for better accuracy of their sonar hammer-headed bats like other mega bats mostly eat fruit which are turi ously sedentary they don't have to snag them out of the air like bat sensing bugs so mega bats actually you're usually pretty cute not so for this boy this weird face exists as far as we can tell for one reason and one reason only the lek lekking is a mating behavior where a bunch of males gather in a central location to display out two females who then pick the male that they are most interested in that area is called the lek which yes in my opinion would be a very good name for a dating app thank you for asking ever headed bats display not through visual traits but through noise that giant rostrum and the fleshy lips and the split nose all help them make a big kind of awful noise that female hammerhead bats which by the way don't look nearly as weird as the males apparently find really sexy and now because we can we're all gonna listen to that noise together great as with so many bizarre things in nature this face that only a nocturnal species could love comes down to sexual selection so if I had a chance to rewrite that Snopes page I would add one single sentence yes they do look terrible but get this that weird face only exists so that they can sound terrible to John I'll see you on Tuesday bizarre beasts is a series that I'm doing on a vlogbrothers I think I only have a couple more of them left and if you're subscribed to our pin club you could be expecting to get the hammer headed back soon I just got my hand fish in the mail it's really good I like that one if you didn't sign up for the bizarre beast fin Club and you want to it's you can't I'm sorry we'll try and figure out something for you in the future good morning John I guess I'm old now and you know how I got to be okay with it here's what I did I lied about my age but I turned 38 I realized that there was practically no difference between that age and 40 both in terms of how I was going to feel physically and also how I was going to be perceived so I just started to say I was 40 and now it's been completely normalized for me so there was no sense of like a negative aging moment in this wonderful birthday which was really great I may have lived my entire life perfectly to have the best possible 40th birthday and isolation the part of that is having a really wonderful family and a really wonderful child and so I wasn't actually isolated I was with them but I also have a lot of practice at and experience with finding community on the Internet and I want to thank you John and also everybody in this community for being a part of that for me it's really helpful in these times but there's a bunch of other reasons why I had a great birthday and I want to go over over them the first one is that I had time and a chance and the inspiration to write a song and so I'm gonna play a song on this channel which I haven't done in a long time there is a piece of our Anatomy it's important and it's great it's the final destination of that chocolate bar you ate inside it is inside and outside it is out and I think it's pretty clear exactly what I'm talking about but there's one thing that I didn't learn and so I cannot help but ask I wonder what's inside your football I wonder what's inside your butt although maybe it is astronauts and maybe it is aliens all inside your butthole it's inside your butthole I always want to know what's inside you thought hole I always want to know oh maybe it is dinosaurs and maybe this monster trucks all inside your butt Oh [Music] if you saw the thing on Twitter you know that I didn't I did not write that song was written by an eight-year-old child who went viral on Twitter with really good song about buttholes I had it a little bit at the beginning of the end to round it up was that necessary for this to be a work of genius no thang number two pure serendipity my son slept in he walked into the room and he said happy birthday daddy when he usually says waffles or something similar ly demanding number three my parents in LA watched the nerdfighter created all-star Smash Mouth mash-up with vlogbrothers clips but they don't know what smash mouths all-star is so that was their first exposure to Smash Mouth his all-star number four finding the original is amazing but making a Smash Mouth cinema jig is next-level number five was at the grocery store getting groceries and they carded to me and I was like I'm turning 40 today and you're you think I might be 21 then I realized that I looked like this so it's a little less impressive I haven't aged a lot in the forehead I think number six none pizza with left Hank has now almost outsold none pizza with left John and it's on sale for another I think two days so maybe that'll happen but in any case waking up to find out that that existed was cool day number seven I literally finished my last edits to my book and sent them in and we're officially 60 days two months from publication right Katherine did something so nice that it would really made my year I want to explain what she did in order to have other people do it for other people but I also just want to cherish it in my own heart and it would take too long anyway I don't have time I had to sing a whole butthole so it also Arne made me this ladybug sitting on a leaf rock sculpture and he made me a card and when I asked him what's on it he said a spiral which I thought John you would appreciate thank you John for doing things for me thank you everyone for doing things for each other it's it's the it's the real stuff right it's the real stuff sometimes I attempt to end eloquently not this time it's the real stuff John I miss you I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John at your suggestion I'm headed to a big ball not actually for clarity I'm home in Montana but my guess is that a lot of people right now wouldn't mind going on a bit of a road trip one frozen in time a couple of months ago a road trip I went on before things got all hinky like just before and I was going to upload this video months ago but then other things happened so I was driving from your house to Albion College in Michigan which took us basically right past an attraction that you have shared with me and that I've wanted to visit for about a decade so since we could probably all use a little change right now since maybe we want to get away from our places let's go on that trip this feels like the part of the world where the biggest ball of pain would be the world's largest ball of paint is not like anywhere in particular in fact driving to it you get the distinct impression that you are headed from nowhere to nowhere and the really wild thing is as you get closer and closer and you see the little dot on your phone saying you're nearly there it does not feel like you're getting anywhere closer to anything to the point where as we approached I stopped believing it was going to exist where the heck there's no sign this is this cannot be it come on ball paint what world's largest ball of paint that's the dice it's not all bad it's not yep we drove to the world's largest ball of paint and the world's largest ball of paint was closed sad sad just kidding he turned the light on did he John the world's largest ball of paint is very very big over 40 years ago this guy had his son paint a baseball and John this is that baseball John while we're talking to Michael about his big ball of paint I cannot stop having this wild destructive thought that I want nothing more in the world than to cut this thing in half I know it's a terrible thought I don't want to destroy this perfect thing but it's like standing on the edge of cliff and wanting to step off I just can't stop thinking it but luckily I managed to avoid saying that I want to slice this man's ball and half for long enough that something amazing happens John they just brought you up unprompted I'm making a video okay who else he got up there he's a big advocate of the paint we all influenced each other of course but I don't think you would have had the thought that you might influence this guy enough that he would bring you up unprompted to me I kept telling him what a big fan you are and I know you can't go now but when this is all done with John you need to go see Michael Monica and I then painted the ball a little bit but Michael told us not to paint the whole thing because he had heard that there were some people who were gonna show up and suddenly they did these three nice young people and I felt a little like I was kind of no longer inside of my story but inside of theirs and that their road trip had this extraordinarily minor character that was me the guy who painted the other half of the ball and then I was thinking that you were in Michael's story and them in mine and maybe the real main character was the and we were all just playing bit parts revolving around it like a bunch of minor satellites in a place that is always there and is never nowhere in a place like any other and unlike anywhere else but then it flung me free and we were on the road again the story's shifting but the ball always there waiting waiting for next time John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John I have done the science and the results the results are shocking I got to sign a lot of pieces of paper for the sign edition of my new book a beautifully foolish endeavor out July 7th you can order them now there's links in the description so I figured this is like a once in a lifetime opportunity for some science so I went on the Amazon and I spent an irresponsibly large amount of money buying permanent markers biggest problem is that many times to get one black marker I would have to buy the entire rainbow but I did it John and you want to know I actually really enjoyed this entire process now there's a few caveats here one I'm going to spend way more than four minutes on this video so it'll be a long version over on a Hank's chance second this is not a comprehensive collection of all the permanent markers in the world it's only the ones that I could find easily and third this isn't really a scientific I only tested one of each kind of marker for example when I stopped was subjective it was when I felt like the marker wasn't doing well enough anymore this is the Ticonderoga ready sharp plus this is my favorite feeling pen burst it's got this little thumb divot that lets you push the cap off really easily and it's also one of the few pens here that has a soft rubber grip and the third thing that makes this pen a more pleasant experience is the smell it'll has almost none this pen uses a completely different chemistry than all the other pens here and it makes it less damaging to plastics chemistry apparently can also hold less ink it's signed about a third of what our leading champions here jazz for the worst experiences the second worse I'm going to say is the u.s. art supply only because the cap doesn't fit well on the base and that Wiggles around and falls off and if I can't be held responsible for where my pen cap is that's definitely the worst experience is the pocket shark which is a pen that has a screw on cap and is designed to withstand like war which is ridiculous because it only signed like 75 sheets of paper so I don't need the outside of the pen to last a long time when the inside isn't going to last at all but the biggest problem with it is that it is just extremely unpleasant to sign with now two of our top contenders for longevity of marker are very thin markers because of course when you have a thinner point less ink comes out per signature what a Sharpie does and why they call it a Sharpie is it's actually sure at the tip and so when you first start signing with a sharpie you having less ink come out per signature as time goes on the Sharpie actually gets more dull and more ink comes up for signature at the same time there's less ink in the pen and over time especially when the pen is moving fast the ink isn't being laid down fast enough and so you get these gaps in the signature now people who talk about whether Sharpie is the best sharpie it really have one major contender in mind and that is the Milwaukee inks all it is a thinner tip than the sharpie because it has that thinner tip it's going to have more longevity per amount of ink inside it and I like this pen and went really smooth that lasted a long time I like the design of it but it was not not not our longevity when John and you've said this to me you said you've tried every permanent marker there is and that Sharpie makes the best marker and John I am willing to say that some pen companies do better on the ergonomics a sharpie nonetheless and not by a huge margin did have the most longevity of any pen I tried every time I went back to the Sharpie after using some of these other pens it was just better but John there is also a stack of paper here that I did not include has a final twist at the end and it is a massive stack it is 50% higher than the traditional sharpie what pen is that might you ask John it is the metal sharpie the tip is less sharp but it laid down some egg takes out the sharpest tool in the shed but it definitely has the most longevity I really thought this would be like super worth doing that I might find some diamond somewhere but Sharpie really does have it figured out and this what am I supposed to do with this John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John one of the main thing about fish is the swimming being on land can suck because of how stuck you are to it like the top-performing human in the world right now can get like eight feet off the ground unassisted and then after all that work they just come right back down this doesn't actually sound that bad until you look at it but like lots of animals have like literally evolved their arms off to be able to swim up into the air bugs bats birds flying is extremely useful it adds a third dimension to the two-dimensional world I inhabit it's easy to forget that air is a fluid until you stick your face under one of those high-performance hand dryers water is also a fluid it's just much more dense animals who live there all of them fly through water well okay not all John this is the red hand fish they can swim but they almost never do instead when they move which they rarely do they walk across the bottom of the ocean on their modified fins that look almost upsettingly hand like canned fish are kind of angler fish and they live in only one place in the world southeastern Australia and they're not doing great the red hand fish is arguably the rarest fish on earth there are only two populations each with less than 50 adult individual though it's not for lack of trying hand fish mom's vigilantly protect their eggs from potential nerado's for weeks on end never leaving them until they hatch and every time a clutch of red hand fish eggs hatches the world population of red hand fish literally doubles so most fish used these hatching events for what's called dispersal the little fish are larval forms and they become like planktonic they just let the ocean carry them around most of them end up in places that aren't gonna be great but some of them end up in places where they can thrive but no and this is very weird hand fish babies are just hand fish that are smaller they have no swim bladders just like adult hand fish they just sink to the ground because they are very dense just like adult hand fish so there are these two isolated pockets where red hand fish are and all the babies just fall to the ground in the two places where they're left this is not great for the survival of the speed c--'s indeed and this kind of blew my mind the iucn which is the organization responsible for this stuff has classified only one marine fish as officially extinct that was not meant to be a pond and this is not to say that there haven't been other marine fish that have gone extinct this is more a function of not knowing very much about the ocean the smooth hand fish is known from a single museum specimen that was collected 203 years ago and after a lot of science and a lot of surveys it has not been seen since will the red hand fish share its fate possibly but the good news is that the hand fish conservation project is right now raising recently hatched hand fish in captivity allowing them to introduce new genetic diversity into these two isolated populations and potentially to reintroduce them to new habitats and as for why these little angler fish choose to walk instead of fly through their world this is really important there is a reason but we do not know it we do not know almost everything we feel like we do because we have a tremendous bias toward knowing things that are known because of how we cannot know the things that are unknown making these bizarre beasts videos reminds me that the things we hear about these amazing astounding facts from the natural world every one of those isn't something that somebody like picked out of a book it was something that was discovered or figured out by a person by people the most bizarre of beasts John I'll see you on Tuesday thank you to the wonderful people at the hand fish conservation project for helping me out with this video and also for all the lovely footage I love your fish thank you for trying to save them check out their work at hand fish orj you good morning John I doubt anyone will be surprised to hear that right now I am a little bit my worry as you have put it eloquently is omnidirectional but there are also pieces of this that I do find encouraging so I feel like it's probably more productive to talk about that stuff right now here five things that I'm finding encouraging right now one if there is ever a time in which we in America will recognize that having most people get their health care through their employer is arbitrary and cruel and ludicrous this is the moment second maybe we are realizing how much work goes into making the world function well maybe after we're done with this that we will appreciate the work done by other people more whether we are currently being asked to live without it like as is the case with many teachers and childcare workers or if we have been asked to imagine what the world would be like without their work and how much we very much do not want to live in that world third thing we are currently at least for now listening to expertise a lot of people who found it like good marketing or politically useful to say that like a gut feeling of a regular person is equal to or superior to like decade's worth of expertise are now suddenly very glad that the expertise exists number four among the underappreciated institutions that are feeling really necessary right now is just government and I'm not saying that like all governments have done this well I'm saying that government is very necessary in this moment and there are a lot of people who spend a lot of time trying to cut and cut and cut government who are suddenly very very quiet government responses being bad isn't because government is bad it's because government has been hobbled by years and years of people saying that it's not necessary and attacking it and also having this war on expertise that has forced people who are experts out of positions in public service and last right now we are acting as a society we tell a really individualist story about how things get done in America individualism is a good story it's empowering and I think that it does a lot of good not really a true story as the saying goes we live in a society and right now we know it kind of just realized this while I was making this video but I think we are in the middle of the largest collective intentional action that has ever been taken I'm not saying this is good this is bad not just the illness and the loss of life but the inequity of how it is hitting and will hit us not just the economic fallout but again that's gonna hit very unevenly and I'm worried that in a moment that calls for maybe even requires a lot of international cooperation this is gonna make us even more nationalistic and again I'm worried that we're trusting experts right now but a little bit down the road when we are dealing with the repercussions of this and people might be saying like oh it wasn't as bad as they said it was gonna be those messages will work even if right now these experts and their policies are saving thousands of lives a day because here's the thing about having strong opinions and no expertise you always get to pretend that you're right because your advice never gets taken and so you can say that you were right you were right you were right because there's no one running the simulation where we did it your way and thank the Lord my worries are in every direction but I do not have less faith in humanity now than I did three months ago and that's something and with that in mind like with the knowledge my own need for it I've decided to do a little project it's a weekly I think 20 minute podcast called Cove it sucks people don't where I talk to some people who are trying to make this better a first interview for example is with a guy who just this week got his first injection of an experimental Kovan 19 vaccine he's one of 45 people in the world in that trial and he is surprisingly chill about it links in the description John I'll see you on Tuesday morning John remember back in 2011 when we launched two YouTube channels scishow and crash course that are now way bigger than vlogbrothers and both have over a billion views on her channels I've been really glad that we did that for a long time but what I didn't know is that those channels and a bunch of other ones we do like the art assignment and healthcare triage and scishow kids would suddenly become more useful during a pandemic like I didn't think that would happen because I didn't think there would be a pandemic I've said this a lot but the goal of those things isn't to replace the classroom it's to help learners and teachers teach and learn because you can't replace the classroom but now temporarily we are being forced a little bit to kind of replace classrooms for a time and a lot of that replacement is teaching over live video doing live streams is something that I have a little bit of experience with at making videos something I have a lot of experience with so with that in mind here are some tips for how to do good live stream let's go first lighting matters more than your camera this is what I look like on my webcam with just the normal lights in my office now I will plug in my light it the brightest light you can and put it like a 45 degrees off center from you so it's running on one side of your face the other side of your face will be lit probably by just ambient room light second thing audio also matters more than video so talk fairly loud like this is not my normal speaking voice you can afford to drop 40 or 50 dollars on a mic and a light I've put some links in the descriptions to cheap ones that are good third fairly basic arrange your screen so that you are facing toward your camera you don't have to stare into the lens the whole time earth the rule of thirds divide your screen into thirds horizontally don't have your eyes in the middle that's weird put them on the third line why I don't know if background does matter this might be a little too busy but don't have nothing number six all the best live streams have some kind of audience interaction even if you aren't interacting with every single person if you are interacting with some people it makes everyone feel like they are being interacted with especially if no one's ever sure which person is going to be the one who is going to be interacting everybody present and feeling like they're in the same space together number seven lag is a thing and it is avoidable if you say something and someone doesn't answer immediately don't start talking because chances are they will start talking to you shortly member eight if you can directly wire your computer via an actual cord to the internet that will decrease the chances of something going wrong number nine this is one to take with a grain of salt bone I'm doing a live stream I do not like to script but I do like to outline I like to know roughly what I'm going to say but I don't want to know exactly what I'm gonna say don't want that super pre-planned energy but you also don't want that super chaotic I'm not sure what I'm gonna say next energy number ten it is totally fine to feel weirded out by this and to be nervous and not great at it this is not what you were hired to do keep at it if you want to practice while no one's there there's nothing wrong with that except that your cat or spouse might think you're going loony and if you keep doing it it does get less weird and finally number eleven use whatever resources are at your disposal there are lots of teachers doing this right now do your best to learn from them to connect with them to help them and also the internet is full of great videos like crash course but all kinds that are there for you to use and indeed crash course is launching a video series right now with Arizona State University called study hall it's a series of learning playlists we're gonna look at topics from writing and Composition to algebra to chemistry and more important than ever these days data literacy the first episode on composition is on the internet now the goal of study hall is to help as many people as possible be successful in their education whether their current students want to fill some gaps before going back to school or just want to learn this is for you and we wanted to make it free for everyone to see you can subscribe now at youtube.com slash ASU John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John around a hundred million years ago the continent that is currently North America was two or three large islands and slicing through the space between these islands was a massive shallow ocean called the Western interior Seaway it stretched all the way from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean at its deepest this giant sea was just 900 meters deep for comparison the deepest point in the Mediterranean Sea is five thousand metres deep it was warm it was shallow there were rivers from all over the place dumping nutrients into this thing and today all over the interior of America you can still see the remnants of that time there are these little cylinders they look like maybe crystals or fossilized plant parts but really they are the remains of crinoids zis tree like filter feeders blanketed that sea but they were not plants they were animals beautiful animals and if you've ever wanted to see a fossil come to life I've got good news for you because one crinoids are still common on earth as they have been for nearly half a billion years and too they do not disappoint in their beauty and oddity crinoids come in two main flavors today the stalked kind which we call sea lilies and the unstopped kinds which we call feather stars now they look more like a kind of coral than anything else like that they would just sit anchored to one spot and the ocean filtering plankton on the water and chilling out but corals our collections of tiny organisms and corals are very much stuck to one place crinoids our animals they are macro organisms like us and they can though they don't often move oh yeah I mean I maybe forgot to mention the main thing about feather stars which is this like you've probably seen viral videos of this movement but it isn't the kind of thing that like it hurts to watch again crinoids spend almost all of their time sitting in one spot but they spend almost all of their viral video time engaging in this amazing mesmerizing locomotion like other echinoderms like starfish sea urchins eat cucumbers etc feather stars are Penta radially symmetrical they have five-sided symmetry this is harder to see in crinoids but it is a thing they might have any number of legs but that number should be divisible by five except that they often get their legs chewed off or knocked off they are pretty delicate but they could describe them back and while feather stars move around looking like the most unearthly gorgeous thing that has yet happened see lilies which are essentially the same thing like their different species but very similar when they move around yeah they just drag their stock behind them just trudging across the ocean floor um check this out their blood they have a vascular system their blood is just water transports oxygen and nutrients and waste it does the whole vascular system thing but it's just seawater talking about an organism that figured out how to do its thing before blood existed and is still doing that crinoids have continued to adapt like their locomotion that wasn't happening 500 million years ago that's relatively recent I mean like 200 million years ago but still try nodes y'all did it good work just keep swimming I guess is what this is if you're a member of the bizarre B spin club we sent out feather stars early instead of armadillos if you're wondering whose fault that makes up was wonder no longer thank you for being a part of that project all the money from it's going to help some of the most vulnerable people in the world so that everybody knows the dftba warehouse and store have been closed down everybody is still on staff we hope to be up and running soon John this episode was a really great break for me I hope it was for for you as well and I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John so I want to talk about something I've never talked about on the channel before and it's kind of a biggie so I went ahead and asked on the community tab if it was okay if I did an extra long video that's more than four minutes and the resounding answer was yes back in 2003 or 2004 I started to feel a lot of pain in my intestinal area and it just kept getting worse and there are other bad symptoms pain for me was the big one it was a lot some days it was like ah that's a bad like sort of you know intestinal cramping some days it was like there's a cactus in me in me it kind of ramped up slowly and in the way of a slow ramp I kind of maybe put off going to the doctor a little too long but I finally did I went to the doctor and they had no idea what was wrong with me could have been a bacterial overgrowth or maybe an allergy to something maybe an autoimmune disorder maybe colon cancer those things range really widely in severity some can be taken care of in a month and you never have to think about it again somewhere with you forever some you might die out and this was a really bad time not just because of the uncertainty but also because I was experiencing a lot of bad symptoms I was losing weight I knew there was something serious wrong during the months I was undiagnosed I spent a lot of time feeling like I was probably just fine it was gonna get better on its own and I spent a lot of time feeling like this was very very bad and then eventually I got my first colonoscopy and I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis which is an autoimmune disorder where your immune cells attack the lining of your colon your large intestine which is the colon those are the same thing it's then forms ulcers which are painful and it does not do its job well which is to reabsorb water so you go to the bathroom a lot sometimes when you least expect it that's pretty bad it makes it hard to be a normal person also it really dramatically increases your chances of getting colon cancer which is also bad the thing is like this diagnosis didn't say like okay now we know what your future looks like it was just one piece of information and ulcerative colitis expresses very different and different people different drugs work more or less well for different people some people have to have their clothes removed pretty immediately some people can live their whole lives with their colon still inside of their body so basically I had this one new piece of information but it opened up all of these other questions so there wasn't anything certain except I knew one thing which is that my future definitely was not going to be what I had imagined it would be when I was a kid I was both active and not particularly coordinated so I broke a number of bones and I got to know the feeling of what it's like when you break a but first there's the actual feeling which sometimes you're not sure but sometimes you are and then there's another feeling there's a sudden realization especially after the third or fourth broken bone when you've been through this before that your life is not gonna be the same anymore and there is no way to reacquire that sameness this is a very particular feeling and I had a first with broken bones but I have had it a lot since it might be having a relationship fall apart or that moment right before you hit the car that's in front of you maybe it's a diagnosis for you or for a loved one it's such a specific feeling this moment where you suddenly realize that you don't know what the future holds anymore and the story you've been quietly silently telling yourself about what the future is going to be like that story just falls apart it's not there anymore it doesn't get replaced with something it's just gone I wanted to know what this feeling is called because it seems so specific that there should be a name for it I've experienced it a bunch of times I could not find a word for this in English I wrote to Susie Dent who is my favorite game show linguist and she actually wrote me back on Twitter and here's what she said I've been wondering similar four days I keep returning to withering a rushing or raging that you're powerless to stop Emily Bronte described it as an atmospheric tumult this isn't quite it but it's like close enough to it that maybe we can make it it because there isn't a word for it I'm also open to other suggestions in the comments I've described it as best I can but I would love for there to be a word what are the amazing things about a with a ring is that the these moments when you realize that like your expectations aren't going to be met are often the first time you realize you even had these expectations like I didn't realize I had an expectation that I would always be able to eat popcorn or that I would always have a colon inside of me now of course many years later the reality that I might someday have to have my colon removed is a normal everyday thought to me it was not then the expectation shifted and I have a new normal but that did not happen quickly when I first was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis I didn't really know anything about it and we also didn't know like me and my doctor didn't know how I was going to respond to medications and first we start out with the stuff that's been around the longest that is least likely to work but has the fewest side-effects and I actually responded really well to it I started to gain weight I I wasn't in as much pain anymore I was close to or all the way into what we call remission and then when you were out of remission and ulcerative colitis speak you're having a flare-up but anyway this was my first time into remission after having my initial flare and I started to think okay maybe I don't actually have ulcerative colitis like I feel kind of fine now maybe the doctor was wrong about this maybe I don't have to reshape my entire imagining of what my life is gonna be like I didn't want the new reality to be real so I was looking for reasons why it wasn't right so I went off my medicine and I immediately went right into a flare that was worse than it ever had been and it took me a really long time to get that back under control again now this process of like taking the disease really seriously and like understanding that this is something that I'm gonna have to live with and that I have a new normal now and then reverting to this you know gut level hope that maybe it isn't real that kept going on for like a surprisingly long time I made mistakes along the way I wasn't always careful about my health sometimes I ate things that I knew might give me a flare-up and sometimes they did and now more than 15 years later I I have been popcorn abstinent for over a decade and there are things about my life that are different i structure my life around my disease a little bit and I know that there's a possibility that like things are gonna get much worse and I'm try to be clear about that with the people in my life and I can expect pain and sometimes it's gonna be manageable and sometimes it's not what's gone is the withering that that emptiness ahead that my previous conception of the future used to inhabit and all of the irrationality and the chaos that comes along with not having anything in that space anymore I've had this disease for over 15 years and now I know what I'm doing with it I understand my life better I it's part of my imagining of my future faster you can get to that point it the better but but like you can't just do it it can't just happen first because it takes a long time to just understand what the future is gonna be like you don't you actually don't know somebody could tell you that that'd be one thing but they can't because it's different for different people and we don't actually know but second because even if somebody could tell you what normal is like now yeah you wouldn't believe them I I mean I know that I couldn't your mind's gonna be searching for ways to make the story make sense so it's gonna be like swinging around wildly from one extreme to the other trying to find like the the place that that actually meshes with like observed reality some days your mind is gonna find ways to believe that everything is actually the same and that this whole thing is a lie other days you're gonna swing exactly in the other direction and you're gonna be overwhelmed with frustration and fear and anger that's swinging back and forth isn't like a symptom it's a strategy this is how we find where normal is it's like if the ground suddenly started moving underneath you like you'd have to balance and like move from one direction to the other to find find some stability you might even need to like drop to one knee right but then when the ground stops moving you'll rise this process is stressful it's cognitively taxing you might be more susceptible to addiction or to negative or unproductive thoughts I know that is the case for me but eventually there is a stability there there is a new version of reality that you can place yourself into it it just takes time to rebuild that John if you couldn't tell talking about this today and I've been thinking about it a lot because it feels like the process of getting diagnosed and coming to terms with a chronic illness feels somewhat similar to that's what's happening right now Janet just you know gestures broad like first we knew something was wrong we didn't know how serious it was so we're trying to figure that out and we understood that it was serious we understood the problem better but that also through a bunch of unknowns in our face right now it feels like we're in the part where you're just Dale oozed with uncertainties and that makes the process of sort of like imagining the future really hard and that creates in inevitable stress and inevitable this this wave finding process of like overreaction under reaction and not being sure whether you're doing either at any given moment but eventually we do get to a new normal there will be a stability out there even when reality reaches some kind of stable state it's gonna take us each individually and collectively a long time to sort of figure out exactly what that is to actually understand it and we're gonna rock back and forth and we're gonna have moments where we think this isn't a big deal and moments when we are blissfully free of it and moments when we are crushed by it and it's gonna suck but we will catch ourselves and we will rise because that's what we do and at least this time it's gonna be something we do together like this isn't gonna be the same for everybody it's gonna be much worse for some people than for others but we can go through it together in a way that we can't with most withering times and we can also learn from each other so here's what I learned from my disruption first I needed to not believe my gut feelings and I needed to believe my doctor I needed to do things to create stability in my life that helped me imagine the future better I needed to find routines that were livable and enjoyable inside of my new normal and I needed to rely on other people and accept their help when I needed it I needed to let myself be weak in the moments when I couldn't be strong and I needed to let myself be strong in the moments when I could I hope those learnings are useful to me in the coming months but even more I hope they are useful to other people John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning john i recorded this video last night i wanted to provide an update to it which is that uh it looks like i'm about to give you some bad news i'm not just within the current context i want to be clear that i'm feeling mentally uh not great physically fine okay good morning john oh boy it's currently what a clock in the morning oh my gosh it's almost two i've been doing the anxious scroll to some extent not super surprising there but in between that i've been doing something wonderful that i feel like a bad person for not doing more two reasons one in like the way that you think i mean we're like i should do this more because it's it's good it's just a good thing to do but two with the other in the other way like i'm a bad i'm just bad at being a person because this is so obvious and so good and i like it and i don't do it which is that i called a friend i called two people people who i don't like call on the phone that often yeah we talked something about kovan 19 but we also talked about like bread and star wars and work and coffee and like the nor like stuff that people talk about and it was lovely when i'm doing the anxious scroll i feel as if i am doing something useful and i'm seeing the same three to five stories over and over again so that they seem like 300 to 500 stories and i want to know more and i want to know what it's going to be like tomorrow and i want to know what it's going to be like in three weeks and i feel like i'm doing something that's going to uncover that reality and cover that truth and it is just not but you call up a friend or you call up a family member and all of it just kind of goes away a little bit and you can talk about movies talk about books you talk about the past or talk about the hard time a mutual friend is going through and how you guys are gonna help them and feel ways and rant and and get mad and be happy and laugh you're up on twitter and it's like don't forget stresslord is your immune system and i'm like okay first of all that's like a little dubious what exactly that means is complicated second do you think that's gonna make me less stressed out yeah no but what does make me less stressed out and maybe this isn't the same for you is calling a friend talking to him somebody may be from a while ago somebody you haven't talked to that much somebody just want to check up on it and say like hey i think about you i care about you i think you care about me i should do that every day it's it's good it feels good and the more i don't do it the more i feel like i i can't do it so happy to have good people in my life and instead of searching for the next the next scare for the next outrage for the next piece of news the next bit of context i should be occupying all of this all of the tremendous power that i have at my disposal connecting with someone john thanks for hanging out my hotel bed i'll see you on tuesday good morning John after college I got a job working all by myself in a fungicide quality control laboratory I know it sounds super exciting it was actually pretty exciting though because I was the only person there and so I managed the lab all by myself I ordered things I designed SOPs I did all the tests I listened to lots of punk rock but also it was awful because I would go to work and I would work all day and I would not see a single living thing that wasn't a mold it was extremely boring and lonely as evidenced by these pictures of me wearing produce bags on my head I've just gotten my first digital camera and I was out to make some content but then some days I did see other living things that weren't mold because it was Florida and I might see a black racer or a frog or get stung by a yellow jacket and then one day I saw outside of my window this little group of armadillos looking real cute and I thought I'll take my new digital camera and I'll take a bunch of pictures of them now we are aware these days that you can get diseases from animals and you can get leprosy from armadillos the official advices do not handle them unnecessarily and I did not but if I wore my headphones and listen to punk rock they would come over and they would snuff on my head I think because they thought maybe they used or seven seconds was actually like a little bug crawling around as they do use their rabbit like ears to listen for prey good fact actually the Aztec word for armadillo translates to turtle rabbit I did not get a leprosy from these armadillos but even if I had it's fairly treatable now so that's good also sometimes diseases cross from animals to humans and we hear a lot about that but leprosy actually jumped from humans to armadillos so this is not their fault I took so many pictures of these armadillos oh my god I had dad shoes even back then armadillos are most closely related to ant eaters and there have been and are lots of species of armadillos pink fairy armadillos three banded nine banded giant armadillos and then of course in the past there were the glyptodont now extinct probably because of guess who this video is about the nine banded armadillo the only armadillo native to the US and this species also lives other places in North Central and South America but the subspecies that lives in the US interestingly are all very genetically similar suggesting that only a few made it this far north before establishing a population these armadillos also always have litters of identical quadruplets so that role I was hanging out with and yes role is the collective noun for armadillos were probably brothers or sisters all genetically identical other awesome things about armadillos they live in places where there's a lot of water so they have two different ways of getting across water and they can choose which one they do they can either walk under the water because their keratin plates make them so heavy that they sink or or they can inflate their digestive systems and swim on top of the water and they have lots of choices in their lives for example mommy armadillos can decide after mating whether she wants to have those babies now or postpone it if she's stressed out she can push it for up to two years before she starts developing the embryos also when they're threatened they jump really high up in the air which is cool strategy to scare away a predator it's not great it's scaring away cars which is why you might see lots of armadillos on the side of the road that have had bad outcomes and that is sad but the good news is that nine-minute armadillos are great at surviving in the human-created landscape even of an office park outside of Orlando Florida they are abundant as a species they are doing very well and I love them and I loved going back and looking through my old pictures from 2003 and if you are a member of the bizarre beast pin Club yes you will be getting an armadillo in your mailbox sometime soon John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John okay this is I didn't think this was gonna be as difficult as it is it's a bit of a tradition here on vlogbrothers who is this beauty what are you let's find out what's inside the box don't hurt yourself that's the impor jeez I almost gotten let's calm down a little bit what's inside that box another bomb sorry this is heavy it says beautifully foolish endeavor I don't do it toward yourself that's the one ruled inside this box let's just cut the camera down here well do far inside the box pieces of paper or into the vlogbrothers tradition of signing tens of thousands of sheets of paper here they are just do one on camera here will this be the one you get voila how do you know it's this one it'll have a very slightly hairy 8 that's this one that's the worst thing I could have done I was just watching your video from 2011 when you were signing The Fault in Our Stars very quickly and you were a little frazzled and to be honest with you I'm a little frazzled but John more important than that it is I think somewhat unusual that someone has to sign tens of thousands of pieces of paper and so I'm taking this opportunity to do something I'm gonna test every single permanent marker I could find to see which one is the best one and then I will know that no one has ever had a chance to know this before I'm gonna be the one who figures it out because I have that I had the opportunity to be that person I bought like $250 of permanent markers John I want to know what the best ones are so as an example here's the stack that one black sharpie did and here's the stack that one red sharpie did you can see that these sacks are different sizes but we have a lot more pens to go through so yeah it's time for me to destroy to just destroy these pieces of paper I'm sorry I'm not destroying them I'm adding value to them though I am destroying this one I hated that why did I do that a beautifully foolish endeavor is the name of the book and it is out July 7th 2020 and yes signed copies are available for pre-order now if you've already pre-ordered an unsigned copy you can cancel that order it's not a big deal pre-order the signed copy it will be great please do that and when you do it a tiny signal will be sent to a computer somewhere and that computer will say hold on this person has reserved a book and then later up these pieces of paper that I am signing right now will be sent to a binder and they will be bound and to finished copies of a beautifully foolish endeavor and then those books will go off to book distributors and the places where the little mark was made inside of a computer they will say this one is that person's and this piece of paper will go to you and I think that's pretty amazing and then only and only then will your debit card be charged it actually doesn't get charged until they send out the book so that's interest and just to round out the video I got some questions on Twitter this one's from Gabriel lots on these cursed Kirby's my thoughts are no both birds and sheep have flocks are birds sheep or our sheep birds chirp so I doesn't Tarzan have a beard he doesn't want a beard he shaves and finally Kyoko asks how do you coat well new season of RuPaul's Drag Race is coming out so that's gonna help we're working through it we're gonna do it as a species collectively individually I'm gonna do what John did you know that I have a y2k Kalen this is actually before the year 2000 the next millennium time remaining but you can set it to any time and I have it set to the time when my book comes out which is 130 days 2 hours 48 minutes and 55 seconds from now so it's coming it's closer than it's ever been in now it's even closer and now it's closer still John I'll see you on Tuesday I'm fine good morning John it was named that by the Celts sir it was named something close to that it's literally from a Sanskrit word we can feel the age of this place linguistically but that's true of a lot of words like for example the word linguistics is rooted in a word for tongue that stretches back even before Sanskrit but the thames hasn't just been there in name it's actually been there the whole time it was there before it was called the Thames it was there when the first people came when the Celts came when the Romans came when the Normans came and during that entire time up until about fifty years ago it was the default garbage dump for all of those people got something you don't want throw it in the Thames another important bit of context here the Thames is a tidal river it's close enough to the ocean that it's levels are affected by the tides so sometimes it's full and sometimes it empties out and during those times when it empties there are places where the shore gets exposed and in that mud you can find the leavings of millennia coins pipes bottles pottery shards musket balls tooth brushes human remains John right now I'm on my way to see a mudlark the self-assigned name for people who walk in muddy places in England to see what they can find this mudlark has a youtube channel link in the description and I watched that channel and I loved it and I find myself in the enviable position of being able to fairly easily get in touch with and meet the YouTube creators that I absolutely love so I wanted to do it oh we are your neighbors no you're a weirdo well I can they kind of know they might know about this weird ring secret weird room it's not a person yes that's a whole skull it could well be Roman but you know look at all your Papes thing now I've got some lovely Roman posturing oh my god yeah just give your child some lead yeah it's a chew on Victorian baby bottle just a perfect breeding ground for bacteria so it was just terrible for babies to be given milk in this but it is okay to have the worst-looking Teletubby oh it's for a thing that isn't that you're just gonna throw away I know I still I said would I put that out of that I believe you I'm in London for VidCon and it's hard not to feel the context of history in this place I know that's probably not true if you live here unless you're the kind of person who dips their hand into the banks of the Thames River to see what comes out but I feel it and it's also hard for me not to feel the history of my own life and my own industry and work when I'm at VidCon and it's good to have a chance to think about what we will leave and are leaving behind how much more we are creating and what pieces of it will be found in the future and what they will mean to the people who find them I don't think about that a lot it's probably best not to think about it too much but maybe I should think about it some John I'll see you on Tuesday Yaman airport hotels so i gotta wait for a spell as behind the sky I'm waiting for the brain to go by waiting for the plane go by waiting for the brain to go by there's people flying in that sky so I'm waiting for the plane to go back [Music] good morning John there is too much confusion about how to be a human in the world today as an example I present to you the 49 emails we have received at the dear Hank and John email address that include the word airplane and see these questions are about armrest etiquette and plugs and people who won't stop talking but above all they are about the eternal debate to recline or not to recline in short one half says this is my seat there is a button on it and I can go back and the other half says it's your seat but like this space is my space and you coming into it is at least a little bit rude this was inflamed this week by a video that is strong contender for the most annoying thing I've ever seen I'm fairly long I'm not overly so I come in here on this ground even so when someone reclines their seat into my space I do find that I sometimes need to immediately rearrange myself or get stuck with my leg pinned up to my chest now this is of course not HUP dong by the fact that I'm almost always wearing bulky hiking shoes because I am a dad but at the same time my length enos means that I do feel comfortable if I am able to recline some time and so sometimes I will look behind me and say can I is it and then if they say no that's ok sometimes it's a child that I don't ask cuz you're a child that's but-but-but-but-but reason this is a thing now is that over the last 20 or 30 years airplane seats have changed dramatically between the same point on a chair in the next chair there used to be like 36 inches that is shrunk to on average about 31 and as little as 28 this is accomplished in two ways one is by making the seats physically thinner and thus more uncomfortable look at these seats this is ridiculous it's awful accomplished by decreasing the amount of space between you and the thing in front of your face now of course this is all done so that more seats can fit on a plane so that the airline can sell more tickets so that they can make more money selling cheaper tickets because now price comparison sites make airlines extremely price competitive the only good news is that it does make airplanes more carbon efficient per passenger mile so basically it's an effect of the commodification of the airplane seat without any regard for how good that seat is going to be whose fault is that the airline's priceline.com me all of us and just by accident it's good for the planet unsurprisingly there is more tension around this issue than there used to be but that is not what I find to be the interesting thing about this whenever we are brought into close proximity with strangers we discovered that we might have slight differences in how we understand the world that can nonetheless lead to significant disagreement in a world where we less and less commonly share spaces with strangers we get less good at dealing with that conflict and when we don't have good methods for resolving conflict or dealing with imperfect situations and we end up angry and behaving in irrational ways and going viral on Twitter and no one wants that the solution it's actually very simple say this with me I disagree with people about airplane seats and that is okay they understand the world differently than I do and that is okay if a person takes the time and energy to ask me for a favor I will take a deep breath and assume that they are acting in good faith even if I am annoyed even if I think they are being dopey and entitled because society must function and because I cannot truly know their story and because if we cannot share the metal sky-bird what can we share and because going viral on Twitter sucks John I will see you on Tuesday and if you want to see John and I answer good questions like this one often better questions than this one come see dear Hank and John live also the Anthropocene reviewed live the events are emceed by a Minotaur what else could you ask for March 9th in Columbus Ohio March 10th in Carmel Indiana March 11th I'll be talking without John and I'll be in college in Michigan about climate change in the Internet and March 12th in Ann Arbor Michigan good morning John so honestly I just can't right now so instead I'm going to indulge in three things I like a lot home soda carbonation Mars and pedantic over-analysis SodaStream add a Superbowl commercial and what am i top like five SodaStream commercials you might think I'm kidding but no number one is definitely this one from the 90s it's so never really settled on a jingle during those years but they really stuck with get busy with the fizzy like for decades which is a little baffling considering that like I will do a lot with the fizzy but I tend to not get busy with it but anyway Super Bowl commercial Mars SodaStream I got to talk about it right especially because I think there are some teaching moments here shot number one establishing shot from Mars drone cam two shot number two our astronauts on Mars shot number three they're excited about something shot number four shot number five it's water on Mars yeah I'm gonna have some problems with this there's enough confusion already about the water situation REE Mars we're not I probably never gonna find liquid water on Mars it's like physically impossible for there to be liquid water on Mars the temperature is too low for it to be liquid if it was not because the pressure is so low there it would immediately evaporate into a gas into the atmosphere you might have heard of these like streaks that appear on the side of very steep mountains those might be kind of flowing water but they're seeping through soil there also if they exist extremely saline so they've got a bunch of salts in them not like table salt like perchlorate salts which are super toxic shot number six we're at Mission Control which is a very quick shot but I have a lot to say about erst there are no NASA logos here which is a little confusing to me is this a SpaceX thing more important to me though on this beautiful wall of HD images livestream from the surface of Mars on the bottom right hand corner there's a picture of Earth and I zoomed into that picture of Earth and there's a little caption and it says Great Pacific plastic patch look ocean plastic is a big deal but not like we're just gonna keep an eye on it from Mars Mission Control big deal number seven beautiful shot of the water 7.5 same shot but now in an internet news site other articles from this site something about the Super Bowl something about plastic waste optimus about climate change and sparkling water is all the rage on Wall Street with this just for me who else looked at this my biggest problem with this new site is this water on Mars now I'm not just being insufferable here I hear it all the time people are like excited to maybe find water on Mars there is a lot of water on Mars and we've known this for a decade if all the water on Mars right now was melted there would be oceans on Mars and also we know from the Curiosity rover that there once were oceans on Mars shot number eight Billy Nye get that muddy Sun also I have a big old rock on your desk and a microscope facing the wrong way and calculations for gravitation over a distance on your blackboard number nine this young woman is Alyssa Carson who's a science communicator in space enthusiasts oh that's cool also here we get to see that somehow we named our Mars mission after a Roman Emperor who was known largely for debauchery and incompetence why did we do that I don't know subtle dig at the current leadership maybe number 10 refers shot who are these people we have not seen them before also this is the shower we hear the tell-tale sound of a SodaStream 11 close-up on competent woman 12 close-up on competent man 13 and 14 close-up on SodaStream 15 mid shot of incompetent man 16 he's really enjoying his beverage I actually asked on Twitter and somebody knew that this thing is a mass 100 NT microbiological air sampler so like that's a real science thing shot number 17 she looks very worried but this is not the face of a woman whose only Mars water sample has been destroyed it's the face of a woman who realizes that her colleague is about to die of perchlorate poisoning his thyroid is shutting down right now mark it was never safe to go to Mars but we didn't think you'd go out like this Soda Stream get busy with the fizzy John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John now okay what is this why am I doing this now why am i showing you this very bad image you know just because it's objectively one of the best images ever taken in all of human history but first when I was a kid I was really frustrated by something we knew where we lived in our galaxy we knew how big the galaxy was how far away other galaxies were but there was a pretty simple question that no one could answer for me how many stars are in the sky now there's a bunch of reasons why this is a hard question to answer first that number is very different depending on conditions like if it's cloudy the number is zero if you're in the middle of the wilderness on a clear day it is much higher and also it's very different depending on the equipment you're using like if you're using your eyes or binoculars or a space telescope and once you start thinking about equipment then you're not really asking how many stars are in the sky you're asking how many there are in the Milky Way galaxy and now you got a a new problem now you can't just count the stars in the Milky Way for two reasons one if you take a picture of it you can't see a lot of the stars because there are these giant clouds of gas blocking out huge sections of the galaxy second and more importantly there are just too many stars John back to my image this photo is actually two million photos taken over ten years by the spitzer space telescope which ended its mission this week and let's actually move over to some software that will allow me to zoom in on it without crashing my computer spitzer is an infrared telescope which means it can see the heat of stars even through all of those gas clouds and so we can actually see a more unincluded galactic core and still we can't see all of the stars because of all the stars that are in the way it's like a soup of stars like bioluminescent plankton in the waves except that every point of light every microorganism instead is a solar system this view is looking through almost all of the galaxies and because we are taking that picture from the edge of the Milky Way where our son is there's a lot of galaxies to look through instead we can also look outward through the thin band of the galaxy that is between us and the intergalactic void and they're beautifully and upsettingly we have a thinner soup but still a soup John there are a lot of stars and if you ask an astronomer today how many stars there are in the Milky Way they will tell you somewhere between 100 and 400 billion and that just seems so wrong that's a huge range but we cannot count so we estimate based on the galaxy's mass and what we think the average mass of a star is but both of those numbers have significant wiggle room right now and so dear child Hank of the 1980s it is 2020 now and we still don't know how many stars there are in the Milky Way galaxy but you can get an idea of what hundreds of billions of stars look like from this image that took decades of work to create and that's pretty cool John I'll see you on Tuesday thank you to all the people who worked on the spitzer space telescope project over the years this galactic map was of course only one of the amazing achievements of that project it was only a hundred years ago that we were arguing about whether or not the Milky Way was the entire universe or whether there were other galaxies out there the person who finally proved those other galaxies were there and did exist his name was Edwin Hubble and the guy who first conceived of the idea of putting telescopes in outer space and was a huge champion of the hubble space telescope while his name was Lyman strong Spitzer good morning John - this time for another bizarre beast this time I've taken a different tactic and I am approaching an animal that you are familiar with but that is way weirder than I thought just because something as common doesn't mean it's not bizarre and John horses horses they can't puke they can't breathe through their mouths I mean I'm not saying they aren't beautiful animals though in part they were bred to be beautiful it's important to note that there are kinda no wild horses now there's two reasons for that kind of first there are lots of feral horses these are wild individuals of a domesticated species and there are tens of thousands of feral horses in North America the second reason it's a kinda is more interesting in Mongolia there's a species of horse that went extinct in the wild but has now been reintroduced it's called Frizzle skis horse or the taki and it's often called the last wild horse but first this probably isn't the horse that modern horses were domesticated from at least not entirely and second genetic studies indicate that the talkee might actually be a feral descendent of an ancient domesticated horse but here's the thing for thousands of years wild horse herds and domesticated horse herds existed in the same spaces so there isn't really a clear sharp line between domesticated horses and wild horses but the taki with its short legs and zebra like mane is likely a good approximation of what horses looked like before we got our hands on whether or not modern domesticated horses are descended from Priss well ski's horse may be some but probably not entirely a big piece of that would also be Tarpons a wild horse that is now entirely extinct and maybe we have a photo of but we definitely have a drawing of one single drawing that's that's what we have or we could look to cave paintings because these are actually the only images we have of pre domestication horses now I often think of horses as being a eurasian thing but they actually evolved in North America before barely getting out over the Bering Land Bridge before going extinct and then we humans brought them back because they were useful and then they escaped and became wild and so that famous North American Mustang is kind of an invasive species but it's also kind of a reintroduced speed as far as I know that is the only example of that ever happening in history well that is very cool but the thing that really freaks me out about horses is their legs okay a thing you have to understand all terrestrial vertebrates have a really similar body plan we have two four limbs and we have two hind limbs and we have a middle trunk and we have a head on top and at the end of each limb we have feet okay in a few species there are hands which are just like feet that you don't walk on or in bats you have feet that you fly with birds their feet just became this like little nubbin on the end of their arms it sounds strange but to an evolutionary physiologist like hands are just feet that you type with whatever I don't have time to talk about how weird hands are the point is there's a very similar body plan and in all animals in us we have bone bone foot in ostriches bone bone foot in mice bone bone foot in Tyrannosaurus Rex bone bone foot but then you got a horse leg it's bone bone bone bone bone what where is it where is the foots a species in Equus which includes horses and zebras and donkeys are just not closely related to any living species but in the fossil record we can see their toes becoming less and less necessary until they are left walking around on just one big toe those two top bones are leg bones all of the rest of these bones are foot they're foot bones and the horse hoof is just a big old toenail so the next time you see some beautiful galloping stallions just note they're all just walking around on one finger if you look close enough John everything is a bizarre beast so next time we will return to some beasts you are less familiar with John I'll see you on Tuesday Good morning, John. So I’ve been told three times in the last week by creative people running cool businesses that they “really respect my business skills,” and to that, I just would like to say… [LAUGHS] The list of my screw-ups is a mile long and full of cringe. Now I’m not saying that I’m not interested in it, haven’t worked hard. There are reasons why I’m fairly good at this. A big one is that I do like solving problems, I like getting a good feel for them and finding different ways to attack them and worrying about them. I find this to be fun, creative work that’s actually kind of similar to plotting a novel? Two, I see it as good. Employing people, treating them fairly, creating value for the world, finding ways for that value to sustain itself. Three, my dad has run businesses, and whenever I have a problem I can call him and he helps me. It’s… extremely valuable! I could go on! Four, I’ve gotten very lucky with hiring. And all those things have helped, and I’m happy to take some credit where it’s due, but ultimately I have a secret. And it will be absolutely no help when I tell you about it. Every business I have launched that has succeeded has been launched with the support of a really wonderful online community. Honestly, this is part of why DFTBA now gives all of John and my profit to the Maternal Center of Excellence in Sierra Leone. It’s why the Vlogbrothers channel revenue has always been split between charity and supporting smaller educational video channels. When I look at this honestly and objectively and I think about where the value came from, it always feels to me like a lot of the value came from the employees and this community and less from me, because I’m just one person, right? There are times when I have pounded myself into the ground to get things done. I’ve had a lot of bad weeks in my life. But in running a business, it’s important to understand where your value comes from. It’s important to understand your strengths. And this community has always been at the top of the list of our strengths. And that’s not just like marketing to you. It’s finding people who can tell us how to do things, finding people to hire. Getting immediate product feedback! Like there’s a reason I keep talking about soda syrups. I’m trying to get you guys to tell me how you feel about soda syrups! And basically no one has this asset. Now, other people have similar assets, but not like Nerdfighteria, right? Not this good! So I’ve been hesitant to give advice when my biggest asset is something that I don’t tend to share… but! I would like... for us... to build a business! Now here’s how it’s gonna work. If you are a business person and you think you could help this idea by providing mentorship or helping us pick business ideas that are submitted to us, I’ve created a form in the description, and it’s next to the words, “I can help.” If you think you have expertise that will be valuable on a small board of people making decisions and providing mentorship, fill that out! Second, if you are an entrepreneur, if you have a product or a service that you are excited about that you’ve started to grow but you need a push, I’ve got a form for you as well. It’s called, “I need help.” Now in general, we’re looking for stuff that’s beyond the idea stage and that it actually has a product or service or business developed a little bit. You can fill this out with just an idea, but... it better be a banger, basically. But here’s the sticky bit: I’m gonna give this business $50,000… but! If the business is able to become successful over the next three years, we wanna get that $50,000 back to promote maternal health in Sierra Leone. And every year when you do your profit distributions, 10% of after-tax income should also go to support that effort. If that sounds good to you and you’ve got an idea that can grow but needs some mentorship and some support from an amazing audience of cool people who wanna support good things, the form is down in the description. John, I think everybody has the ability to be a business owner. Now, not everybody has the inclination. But even if you don’t, I think everyone should watch the Crash Course Business: Entrepreneurship Learning Playlist. It’s a 17-episode series hosted by Anna Akana that goes over the basics of starting your own business and also of business in general. The link to that playlist is here and in the description, and those forms that I was telling you about are down there as well. John, I’ll see you on Tuesday. Good morning, John. Beginnings and endings... I like it. I like this frame. I love beginnings. I've got several beginnings that I'm interested in. Soda syrups. Sock - anything to do with socks I'm really into right now. I've got a couple things I'd like to end on a sort of a national level. But in terms of me, things that I can definitely do and control, I don't know what I want to end. We interview people for jobs sometimes, sometimes for fairly high-level jobs. I once had somebody come into a job interview and be like, “I could get you to acquisition in just a couple of years,” and I was like, “To ac - to what?” Like, building Complexly up to sell it, and I was just like, “Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I wanna be running this company when I die!” I was really sounding like a moped there for a second. Here's a thing that I would like to end. I would like to end my line edits for my book. What are line edits, Hank? Okay, here's what book writing looks like, if you're in the traditional publishing industry. First, you write a book. I don't know how this works. I don't know. So you've got a manuscript, and you've got an editor. However that happened... is a mystery. But you got it, and you give it to the editor. And then either they tell you,  'This is trash, ' or they write you a letter. And that's called the editorial letter, and it says, “This book is not trash,” followed by a 22 page list of all the ways in which the book is trash. This is the success condition. So then, you finished your big revision. You've basically rewritten the book. There's 50,000 words that aren't in there anymore and 40,000 new ones. Then you get your line edits. And your line edits are like, line by line, your editor goes, “Why did you do this?” Usually it's fairly simple things like it's, you need a different word here because you used this word earlier in the sentence beforehand. And then occasionally you get a line edit that basically says, “Rewrite this chapter,” and you're like, “This isn't a line edit!” And during the line edit is for me when I read the entire book out loud. I'm a slow reader regardless, but reading out loud is particularly slow. Now of course, after your line edit, you get your copy edit, and that's when somebody, in my case last time, the valedictorian of my high school graduating class for some reason, Mary Beth Constant, just reads your entire manuscript and tells you all of the little things you got wrong and that's usually much less troublesome. You're just being like, “Yes, I agree that there should be a comma there. You're right, I did use the wrong word, Mary Beth. Yes, you are still smarter than me all of these years later.” This is maybe the weirdest coincidence of my entire life. I hope I get Mary Beth again. There was literally a single typo in the whole book when it came out, which is amazing. So at this point, you've been changing this book like every day for six, eight months? You've been looking at it and changing things, and then they say, “Don't change anything else!” And your entire mind is built to change the book, and then you have to say, “No!” This is the final! You decide now that all of the words that are in here deserve to be in here, and none of the words that aren't in there should be, and... Gaaaaah! I'm not a high stress person, I'm really not. I'm laid back, but that is too much. That is the biggest ending I'm working toward in 2020, and I'm kind of terrified of it! I like this book a lot. It's… it's much more ambitious than my first book, and I think that it says a lot of interesting and important things that we need to be saying and thinking about right now. But this is one of the great things about creative work, that you are forced to an end. So I guess I'm lucky to have a job where I get lots of little “I did it” moments, whether it's finishing a book or  whether it's finishing this video. John, I'll see you... right now, because we're on tour together. [JOHN:] Hank, you just made a whole video about your book in which you didn't say the name of the book, which is A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor. Nor did you say when it comes out, which is July 7th. And nor did you say that it's available for pre-order now, which it is. Good morning, John. Ten years ago today, I know exactly where I was… because I was inside a Target for 15 hours… Ten years ago! The last ten years have been really big. It’s been big - and I can’t really talk - like, get my mind around it even. But I do know that I have changed a lot and what we do on this channel has changed a lot. For example, in order to prepare for this video, I went to look at my schedule for 2010 and discovered that I didn’t have a schedule in 2010! But I think more importantly than that, over the last ten years, John, you and I have gotten less interested in optimizing this channel for growth for like reaching new audience. If you find your way here, absolutely good work. But we’re not really trying to grow it, for three reasons. One, it’s just gotten harder and our skills are less suited to it. Two, YouTube recommends stuff based on lots of different things. Specifically, it would like us to make 8 to 12 minute long Vlogbrothers videos, and I just don’t want to! I like this! I like making 4 minute videos, and that’s the rules! But most importantly number 3: growth, beyond a certain point, just gets less interesting... and worse? Depending on what you want to do, of course, but like specifically for this channel. Let’s talk about why. But first,  how many nails does a carpenter need? It depends on what they’re building, right? So you have to look and say, “What do I wanna do?” And obviously for any given project, it’s bad to have not enough nails. But after a certain point,  you can have too many nails. Eventually you have so many nails that the nails don't provide you relief from stress. They ADD to your stress. The point is to get to HERE. Eventually you just spend more time thinking about your nails than you do actually building a house. I’ve thought about this a lot in the last couple weeks. I just don’t think that at its core,  Vlogbrothers is about entertainment. Yes, I want to do that sometimes. But I think it’s about doing things together and thinking about things together. Things like Life’s Library and the Project for Awesome and our work with Partners in Health and just all of the ideas that  we’ve talked about over the years that have helped me understand how to be a person and how the world works. And Dear Hank and John and SciShow and Crash Course. SciShow and Crash Course long ago eclipsed Vlogbrothers in subscribers, in views, all that stuff. But Vlogbrothers, just by virtue of the fact that those channels wouldn’t exist without it, has had more impact on the world despite having a smaller audience. Sometime in the last ten years, and not all at once, and not at the same time, John and I realized that you don’t need a million nails to build a house. We actually internalized this - it took awhile - that this channel isn’t about having the biggest number under the video. It’s about doing things, creating stuff, thinking about things together. And not only is that like a goal of mine; it’s also when I’m most happy. And there are limits to that, because I want it to actually be a group of people who recognize the humanity of all of the other people. And as the numbers get too big, you lose track of that. Also, this channel is unquestioningly personality-based. And having too many people have opinions about your personality, it turns out, is not great, actually. Crash Course now has over ten million subscribers, and it should grow as much as it can, because its goal is to reach people with educational content. But Vlogbrothers? Like no, we’re good. You, watching this video, are part of something that helps stuff exist in the world. And that stuff is sometimes real stuff. Sometimes it’s ideas that we wouldn’t have if we weren’t thinking together as a community. That’s pretty weird and it’s cool and it's special and I’m really, really happy about it. And in that vein, three things. First, the Nerdfighteria Census is out! You can go fill it out right now. Thank you so much to people who do that so that we can understand who we all are better. We’ve been doing the census every year since 2013, and it’s super vital to how we make decisions about what we do. So if you can take the 10 to 20 minutes it will take to fill it out, please please please do so. Number two, the Kindle ebook of An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is 3 bucks right now. So if you want to get it dirt cheap, you can. I don’t think it’s gonna be that way for much longer. And finally, if you want to come see us in Atlanta or Raleigh or St. Pete next week, we will be there. John, I’ll see you on Tuesday. Good morning, John. It is our last video of the 20-teens. And I'm tempted to look back: at fidget spinners, at  'The Dress ', at planking - which was this decade, apparently?! But I can't, because I'm too worried about the future and I feel like a lot of people are, so I want to talk about it. And of course, the future is worrying. It is unknown and unknowable. But I also think that worry can get a bad rap, because we do it wrong. So, let's talk about it. But first, in many ways, the world got better over the last 10 years. Even if you just look at America, the world got better over the last 10 years. I had a Motorola Droid in 2009. Eugh! But also, bigger deal, gay marriage was illegal. Also, the unemployment rate went from 10 percent down to 4, and yet, to me, now feels a bit shakier than then did. I'm not really sure why that is. Part of it has to be that we're starting to feel the real effects of climate change in two different ways. One: the actual real effect - the climate is changing. But then secondly, we have a growing populace of young people, knowing that they are gonna be the ones who actually have to solve this problem, looking to their elected leaders, who aren't recognizing that the problem exists. So yeah, that's gonna cause some tension. Also, this is an election year, and it's gonna be stressful because of that. They're always stressful. And, also, we just impeached our president about the fact that he doesn't have a great deal of respect for the process. So yeah, I'm worried about that. I'm also worried that this tension, some of which is actively manufactured by our leaders, or just the architecture of the social internet, or by Russian bot farms, will continue to pull at the bonds of community. And that's a story of the last decade, but beyond that as well, which has had real negative impact. So I just threw a bunch of stuff at you. I probably made you feel super stressed out. I apologize for that, but here's why. There's somewhat of a tendency to say, like, 2019 was such a trash year. There's no way 2020 could be worse, but like, look. I don't mean to continue to freak you out, but it could always be worse. This is one of the reasons why I like science fiction. It's a way to worry about the future, to like play out scenarios in narrative form. Our first Life's Library book of this year, Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler, great example of this. So I actually do worry that we might worry the wrong ways, but I also worry that we might not worry enough! So have fun with that! But here's what's up. We're getting to the point. One of the smartest teachers I ever had once told me that what he looks for in good leaders is worry. People who are brave and bold, yes, but also people who are kept up at night by the possibilities, who think and ruminate and fret. Because worry isn't a disease; it's a symptom of caring. And it's a tool, it's a survival strategy. Being able to think through a situation and assign probabilities to different outcomes, however flawed those probabilities may be, is a human superpower! It is the reason we are alive right now. I don't think all worry is healthy or anything. We do have to find the right ways to be worried and the right things to worry about. We need worries that motivate us and that are also based in reality, rather than ideology or just blind opposition. And also worry almost always works best hand in hand with hope. So, yeah, I'm worried about 2020 because 2020 needs me to be worried about it, just like I need my mom to be worried about me. And I know that it can feel like we are powerless in the face of so many other people who want completely different or slightly different things than we do, and who oftentimes have more resources than we do. But we're not powerless. Who we donate to, who we vote for, the conversations we have, how we choose to imagine the world: all of those things are how the entire human earth gets built. So yes, I'm worried for the future, and yes, I'm glad! John, I'll see you in 2020. P.S. If you are in St. Petersburg, Atlanta, or Raleigh, North Carolina, and you want to come have a good time and also maybe think some big thoughts with us, we're going on a little tour. More information in the description. Good morning, John. It’s your brother, Hank! I have news. If you follow me on social media, you may have already seen it, but my book A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor... has a cover! Designed by the marvelous Kaitlin Kall, it’s a real thing! Now is the book DONE done? No. Is the book done enough that I can read you the first chapter? Yes, it is! This is a mockup of the book, it’s not the real thing. But I’ve taped the words of the first chapter inside of it, so… Here is the first chapter of my second book, A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor, a sequel to An Absolutely Remarkable Thing. Chapter 1. I have decided to stop lying to you. As far as I can tell there are only three kinds of lie: the kind you don’t want to get caught telling, the kind you don’t care if you get caught telling, and the kind you can’t get caught telling. Let’s go through them one by one. 1. The kind you don’t want to get caught telling. This is just your average, every-day lie, whether you’re late for work or did a real bad murder. Getting caught in the lie, thus, is a problem. 2. The kind you don’t care if you get caught telling. This kind of lie is about the lying, not about outcome. You repeat the lie, stick to the lie, change the lie, re-form the lie, abandon the lie, come back to the lie. The lying might help you avoid some negative outcome, but really it’s a tool for weakening reality, and thus strengthening yourself. 3. The kind of lie you can’t get caught telling. This happens when only you know the truth. This is the kind of lie I’ve been telling. For years now, this last kind of lie has felt, to me, like a kindness. I mean, it’s not a surprise that the story of your reality is incomplete. We all know that. Scientists don’t know where most of the matter is. I don’t know what it’s like to live in Yemen. Our imagining of the world isn’t fully accurate. But if you know something no one else knows, something that would change everyone’s story overnight, something that would make everyone else’s life worse, telling the truth might seem like the wrong thing to do, like exercising too much power. As I have discovered, there’s nothing special about me that means I’m particularly suited to making that kind of decision for an entire planet of people. The only reason I get to make it, it turns out, is ugly, vulgar luck. A lot of people have said that I have a habit of exercising  too much power and one of those people is me. Which is why I'm about to do something I'm extremely uncomfortable with: let other people tell the story. Oh, to be clear, I don’t have any choice. I wasn’t there for a lot of this, so it isn’t my story to tell. Which is why you’re about to hear the story from several different perspectives. Maybe that way we can share some of the responsibility of the power of this truth. It won’t be all on me, all of us have to agree that the words in this book are worth putting in here. All of this is to say, I’ve decided to stop lying to you. WE have decided to stop lying to you. Even though the lie is easy to tell, even though I never really said it out loud, even though the lie, most days, feels like nothing more than self preservation, it’s time to tell you about the lie. Here it is, in its most basic form: I have been doing everything I can to make you believe that everything is going to be okay. [CLOSES BOOK] Maybe that’s not quite what you were hoping for with this sequel. Maybe you wanted Chapter 3, which is where some questions start getting answered. But that day is not today! That day is July 7th, 2020. But you don’t have to wait until then to pre-order the book. You can do that now. Also, if you want to come see live Dear Hank & John and live Anthropocene Reviewed and a couple of other weirdnesses, John and I are gonna be in St. Petersburg, Florida, Raleigh, North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia in early January! Come on out! Tickets in the description. John, I'll see you on Tuesday. Good morning, John. I am a little bit shocked by how much I like jigsaw puzzles. Like, you have noticed that I am a little bit obsessed with productivity. We can go ahead and say it. Sometimes it’s unhealthy. I tie my self worth to my output, and then often I tie what I imagine to be my output to external validation from an audience, or in economic terms, or other imperfect surrogates for the magnitude of “impact,” whatever that is. A jigsaw puzzle has none of that. If there is something that has less impact on the world than re-assembling an image of a wintertime scene, I can’t really think of it. But jigsaw puzzles trick my mind into thinking that it matters without any of the responsibility of it actually mattering. And that allows me to - get this - relax and also spend time with friends and family. And there are lots of different things I like about puzzles. I like how it feels like you get to know every puzzle and they’re all just a little bit different. And sometimes they’re very different! And the tricks you develop on one puzzle might not work for another. And in these ways, doing a puzzle is like solving any problem. No two problems are the same, but as you get the feel of the shape of a problem, you get better and better at addressing it. Puzzles also have the advantage of being finite, and so you know when you’re done solving it, which is something that real world problems tend to not have, unfortunately. I am unlike a lot of puzzle people who I know in that taking the puzzle apart is actually my favorite part. I just love watching the complete order of a puzzle being almost instantly reverted to complete disorder. And not because I like love chaos and destruction. Like a little bit I do. But mos - but here’s the thing. I love seeing how hard it is to build something and how easy it is to destroy it. Now, that might not sound like a good thought, but I think it actually is. Because if it is much easier to destroy than build - this is mathematically true so you can’t really deny it - then everything that remains built, every problem that gets solved, every disease that gets cured, everything that just works remains that way only because of human action. Only because of billions of people placing puzzle pieces every day, carefully, and thoughtfully. Obviously, during the Project for Awesome, we are focused on problems. And the puzzles we’re solving here are not puzzles that have the luxury of not mattering. So, we have to look a lot at the problems, and they can feel very heavy. But they need to be looked at, and they need to be understood. And we need to support, the master puzzle-solvers out there who understand the unique shape of each one of these things. Like the people who work at Partners in Health and Save the Children, the charities the Project for Awesome is supporting in its first half. The puzzle of healthcare isn’t simple anywhere, but these organizations help communities build more robust healthcare, decrease illness, they provide stability, and they make the world a better place. Everyone who supports the Project for Awesome by making a video, supporting a charity, joining us on the livestream, or getting some perks at projectforawesome.com/donate… You are helping put puzzle pieces down where they most need to be. The problems of the world can feel like a weight, but they can also feel like a puzzle that, yes, we’re never gonna finish, but that brings a better world with every piece we lay. And the Project for Awesome, by the way, begins shortly at noon eastern time! And you can join us for 48 hours of fun and fundraising and silliness and thoughtfulness at projectforawesome.com/live. John, I will see you on the livestream! Go to projectforawesome.com/donate to find our Indiegogo. There are so many cool perks! And you can get them now and ONLY during the Project for Awesome. Good morning, John. Here in America, it is the day after Thanksgiving, which means that it is Black Fri- [TWITTER:] Hey, Hank! It’s Twitter... It’s Twitter, I have a question. [HANK:] What? [TWITTER:] What’s your most controversial opinion? [HANK:] Oh come on, Twitter. Why would I tell you that? [TWITTER:] Content, man! It’s content! It’s an easy format to put your own personal spin on without having to come up with something fresh. [HANK:] Yeah… No, yeah, that makes sense, but look. My most controversial opinions are pretty controversial. And they’re also like nuanced and take a long time to explain. For example -  [TWITTER:] No! God. You make everything so complicated. You’re just supposed to something dumb that everybody’s gonna be mad about, like, “Indian food is bad and everyone knows it.” [HANK:] Why would anyone say that? Like even if I don’t like Indian food, I recognize that some people must, right? What’s the point? [TWITTER:] To make people mad! [HANK:] Yeah, you’re right… [TWITTER:] It’s ENGAGING. I’m leading you to the water here, but I can’t make you drink! You just have to come up with something dumb that 80 to 90% of people are gonna despise… But then 10 to 20% of people will be on your side and they will have your back, and that’s gonna keep the conversation going! [HANK:] Oh my God! Like... this seems complicated. [TWITTER:] No one said any of this was easy, baby! Your job is to make it look easy! [HANK:] Well, actually… I think it is. [TWITTER:] What? [HANK:] It’s easy. Butt is legs. [TWITTER:] What? [HANK:] Butt... is legs. [TWITTER:] That’s ludicrous… Butt is butt. [HANK:] Butt is butt, but butt is also legs. [TWITTER:] Butt is butt. [HANK:] Butt is legs. [TWITTER:] That’s… I mean, the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard! [HANK:] Look, your leg bone is in your butt. [TWITTER:] But you only have one butt! [HANK:] I know! That’s what makes this such an interesting sentence! It’s grammatically confusing because you have a singular butt, but plural legs! But this isn’t a grammatical question, it’s an anatomical one, and BUTT. IS. LEGS! [TWITTER:] But scientifically, anatomically, your gut is in your torso, and your gut ends in your butthole, which is your butt. So butt is torso, right? [HANK:] The butthole is not legs… The butthole is not butt. [TWITTER:] THE BUTTHOLE IS NOT BUTT?!! It’s in the name!! [HANK:] The butt transitions to butthole, just as hand is not arm. Arm transitions into hand - [TWITTER:] Okay, so hand is not arm! Then shoulder is not arm. Then butt is not legs. [HANK:] Shoulder is arm. [TWITTER:] Don’t say it. [HANK:] And butt is legs. [TWITTER:] AGGH!! GOD!! Okay, look… I can’t tell you why, but you are obviously wrong. [HANK:] YOU TOLD ME TO HAVE A CONTROVERSIAL OPINION!!! WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME FOR HAVING ONE??? [TWITTER:] Oh my God! I did, didn’t I?? Like, I had legitimate - I had forgotten! Good - good work! [HANK:] Twitter, this is the world that we have chosen for ourselves! [TWITTER:] You got any others? [HANK:] Alright, second controversial opinion. Black Friday... is dope. My first book, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing, was picked as a Black Friday deal by Audible in the United Kingdom. So this week in the UK, it’s only three pounds… also! I. HAVE. A BOOK. COMING OUT. July 7th, 2020: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor. I can’t believe I did it, but I did it! And lots of links to preorder that and also get a quick synopsis in the description. I’ll be talking more about it soon. And right through Monday there’s free shipping everywhere in the world for all orders over $50 at DFTBA.com. We have lots of amazing new Black Friday products. I’m wearing many of our pins that are coming out right now. Including this Stentor Coeruleus pin from Journey to the Microcosmos. And also because we did a Pizza John bandana this year, now we are also doing a Hank-erchief…? Look, I don’t expect to sell a lot of them, but we had to make the joke! So go to DFTBA.com right now! [TWITTER:] Was this entire video a set-up for a Black Friday promotion? [HANK:] Controversial opinion? [TWITTER:] Yeah, man! [HANK:] Butt is legs. [TWITTER:] GAAAHHH!!!! [HANK:] John I’ll see you on Tuesday. Good Morning John. Okay, I found out something, and I can’t shut up about it so you’re gonna have to deal with me. A desert island is not a desert island. By which I mean, a desert island can be lush and covered with water, with big rainforest trees. It is not an island that is a desert. It is desert… an adjective that I have been using my WHOLE LIFE without knowing that it exists! “Desert” means uninhabited or deserted. This word, D-E-S-E-R-T, has four different definitions and two different pronunciations. One, desert: noun, a place without much water. Desert, two: adjective, uninhabited. Desert: verb, where you abandon something, like a you’re a deserter. And four, desert: noun, the thing you deserve. Another word I’ve been using my whole life without knowing IT EXISTS! When I say, “You got your just deserts,” I don’t mean, “You got your tasty after meal treat.” In this case, “just” means like you’re fair, and “deserts” means “the things you deserve.” So the “just” part of this idiom is completely irrelevant because every desert is something that is just, it is what you deserve definitionally! And all of this is to say nothing of “dessert” with the extra S, the delicious thing that you eat after you’re done with dinner. This led me into a place that was terrible, and you won’t find out why until the very end. But of course, it being English, we have words for all of these things. We have words for words that sound or look like each other but don’t mean the same thing. So there are three things here that words might have in common. There’s the meaning, there’s how they sound, and there’s how they’re spelled. Now in this situation we’re talking about words that all have different meaning, so I’m just gonna discard that for now. And talk about the suffixes that we use for words that have different meaning but are pronounced the same or are written the same. When we’re talking about pronunciation, we’re talking about how they sound, so we use the suffix -phone. And when we’re talking about how they look, we’re talking about writing, so we use the suffix -graph. And then we have our prefixes: we have hetero- for different and homo- for same. So a homophone is something that sounds the same but has a different definition, and a homograph is something that looks the same but has a different definition. And then you have the word that we talk about, which is “homonym,” and that’s when BOTH of those things are true. So far this makes sense. Not super easy to get your head around, but it makes sense. Homonym: same pronunciation, same spelling, but different meaning like “desert” (sand) and “desert” (abandoned). And all homonyms are also homophones and homographs. But some words are only homophones, and some words are only homographs. Like “desert” (to abandon) and “dessert” (sweet). They sound the same, but they’re spelled different. And this means that they are also something called a heterograph, meaning they look different. And then, my friends, there are things that are spelled the same but sound different. Homographs, like “desert” (sand) and “desert” (to abandon). These things sound different. They are heterophones. And they are called heteronyms. [SEETHING] This took me a HALF AN HOUR OF MY LIFE to figure out! WHY AREN’T THEY CALLED HETEROPHONES? John, I’ll see you on Tuesday. Also, we recently did a thing where there was a map and you could put a pin in it and tell us where you live for when we're going on tour and then it broke! So we had a bunch of pins, and it was beautiful! I really enjoyed looking at it, but now it is no longer useful data. I don't know what happened! So there's a link to a form in the description. Please fill it out! Let us know where we should come when we go on tour next! We're gonna have a weird and fantastic time wherever we end up going, but we need to know where to go! Thanks. Good Morning John, I love audio books. Like I love them a LOT. And not in that like, “Oh, well I don’t have that much time to read anymore, and so I mostly just listen to audiobooks because that's better than not reading at all ' kind of way. No, I love them on their own as a medium. I find them wonderful! I love book book reading as well! I love cascading into this story, into this physical object that has all these marks on a page that turn into this story in my mind. There's nothing in the world like that. But there's also nothing in the world like being told a story. That’s the oldest thing there is. That and like maybe music. I think it's like what made us humans. And maybe like music and stories at the same time? Is every song a story? Think about it and get back to me. There’s been a fair amount of talk about whether listening to an audiobook counts as reading, or if it's like  'cheating. ' These conversations to me seem to be based in two different things. One, like scientifically, psychologically is it the same? No! Like subjectively I can say that it's not the same. A narrator of an audiobook makes a bunch of decisions for me before the information gets to my brain. I might be making some of those decisions differently, so I think the story is in some ways slightly different when it's being read to me. And it seems like retention is measurably better on average when read rather than when being read to. But that's on average, and it's actually different from person to person. This to me doesn't seem like a judgment of better or worse. It seems like it's marginally different. Like not tremendously! But somewhat different. The second place that this conversation comes from, though, is I think from people who have a lot of pride in their identity as a reader or as a reader of a lot of books. Some people love reading lots of books, and they see that as part of what makes them valuable and exceptional. And I think those people are kind of just saying like,  'Part of why I'm proud of myself is that I read a lot of books. And the fact that like somebody got through a lot of books in audio form isn’t the same as the thing that I’m proud of. ' A lot of people push back against this as like exclusionary, but like... All forms of exceptionality are exclusionary. We have a really hard time as humans figuring out why we matter. And there are much worse ways to find pride than, like, the length of your book list. But I’m never going to be one of those people who reads a lot of books in a year. I am very mildly dyslexic. According to this staples.com reading test, I read slower than the average eighth grader. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love reading. I totally do. And it doesn't mean that audiobooks are a replacement for books for me. I like audiobooks as a way to enjoy a story. To me, media is about like enjoying being a human. And loving having a good story told to me by a good storyteller is probably something that I have in common with every single one of my human ancestors. And that's... pretty cool. And it's part of why I pushed pretty hard for our new year of Life’s Library to have an audiobook option. So now you can be a part of this community of readers all consuming the same stuff and connecting about it. And when you sign up, you can choose the audio version with digital perks or with physical perks. And every time we start a new book, you’ll get a code emailed to you. You click on that code, and into your libro.fm account will arrive the new book. I'm curating a month of this year's Life Library. I chose a book that I have read both in book form and audio form. So I know it's good both ways. We decided to do this with Libro.fm because they are just great! You don’t have to be a paying member of Libro.fm to get your book, but you can be! And if you are, you get to choose which bookstore you would like to order your audiobooks from so you can support bookstores in your community. And of course, just like with regular books, you get to keep your audiobook even if you cancel your Life’s Library subscription. So join Life’s Library! There's a link in the description, or you can just click right there. I had to put a video here because YouTube doesn't let us link to anything unless we also link to a video. I don't know why! I find it annoying. John I’ll see you on Tuesday. good morning John it is the final day of pizza myths and this year's pizzas products are only available during these weeks so if you want to be a part of it if you want to get one of these things your time is running out and what a pizza miss it's been we've had left beef good cats let it snow premier you went to people's house is your video yesterday was helpful for

business and I will see you on normal Tuesday conspiracy theory is the YouTube algorithm suggesting vending machine videos because it wants people to get used to the idea of servicing machines good morning John this video has spoilers through the end of season 3 of the good place the good place is a good show about four not very good people who have died and ended up in a very bizarre afterlife through its first two seasons the show explored really deep questions many of the same ones we've been dealing with as humans for thousands of years but then in season 3 as the good place is good at doing it swerves on yeah and suddenly the show isn't about how to be a good person it's about how to be a good person in 2019 a mess y'all spoilers in earnest now a bad place is going to get all of them eventually even your precious PP king dug for said in season 3 we find out that everyone goes to the bad place even the guy who knows the rules and has been doing everything he can his whole life the proposal here is that the modern world is so messed up you can't live in it without being a bad person but most times a lot of points to get to good place was 521 years ago this is kind of a rough thing for me to hear personally because like I kind of believe it the bad place is I'm tampering with points they don't have to because every day the world gets a little more complicated and being a good person gets a little harder or more than ten years one of the central themes of this channel on YouTube has been to engage with the complexity of the world but if you do that what you find isn't that everything's bad it's just that nothing's all the way good the book that you loved that was written by a misogynist the terrible things done in the name of your religion historical atrocities that like all of society is based on and that you may still benefit from every beautiful genius expression of human creativity and hard work has a dark side there's this chicken sandwich that if you eat it it means you hate gay people now unlike Jason's friend big noodle and I love the big noodle allegory I'm the kind of guy who actually has time to figure out whether oat milk is better for the world than almond milk it is what does better than really mean what's the scale here how bad am i if I choose to drink almond milk because I like the taste better and how much worse is that than like being mean to a friend or like putting sprite in my water cup at McDonald's good places answer is the accounting department beings who judge every action you take and determine how many points you get or lose anastasiya and they stuff vegetable Department we call Hector in American coins and my dear buddy Matt weird sex thing and if you don't hit a threshold you go to the bad place the math is cold objective and airtight maybe it is in their universe but it is not in ours one thing the Internet has been really good at for certain people is highlighting all of the many ways unintended harm can be done for others oddly enough it's been really good at insulating them from that it's almost as if the internet amplifies your worldview but for people who are open to the complexity the reality of reality is just way too complicated for the accounting departments of our brains to handle it's almost as if utilitarianism relies on a hyper individualist worldview that isn't reflective of reality individuals make decisions I will never say that's not the case there are many decisions that are much harder than others and that have much greater costs associated with the themes of season 3 quietly but geniusly highlights that our current system of consumerism fueled pop utilitarianism mostly isn't a tool we're using to make the world a better place it is instead a way to rapidly and inaccurately judge the goodness and badness of ourselves and each other so here are four really important things that I learned from this very good content one not everyone has the capacity to weigh every choice they make and that does not make them bad people - it is harder to be the kind of person who seeks complex truths rather than retreats into simple lies but it is also better free morality should only be one part of that curiosity because if it is only about morality then you only view the world through the lens of judgment and number four our accounting departments will always be flawed and so we should not judge ourselves or others as if they are not John we are down to just two days of Pizza miss I will see you tomorrow good morning John it's Thursday so as I mentioned very briefly in my last video I finished a draft of my but what does that mean it means that there's a hundred and forty something thousand words in a document and there's a beginning in the middle and an end are they the words that are gonna be in the final book some of them almost definitely I went to see Tommy orange who wrote they're there last night he gave like a QA at the University of Montana and at one point in the talk he referred to himself as a kind of duality there are times when he's a writer and there's a times when he's a revisionist and that's a completely different job one last thing that he said that really resonated with me about writing and I can't remember exactly how he said it but basically you have to be a reader of your own work and you have to experience it that way you have to just like with music or with any other art you have to try and experience the thing you made and in that process enjoy your own work and I have started revising and I really enjoy this story it's a mess but I think it's gonna be good and not answer some questions about writing and about the book specifically that I got on Twitter any question other than when is it out is irrelevant I don't know it's much sooner now that I finished a draft though lots of things still need to get done I have a lot of people read my work before I publish it though I don't know what I do know is that it's happening at least Britney wants to know am I going to cry well I cried in the Chipotle as I was finishing writing the book what is the title of your new book are you allowed to say yet no I'm not soon as I know for sure I'll tell you because I don't want to do is be like what about this and you'd be like I hate it I want to be like this is it and then you won't tell me if you hate it because that's mean how many pages first book is three hundred and thirtysomething pages long this book will probably be over four hundred I hope it's okay it's a more involved story a lot more happen to get a lot more points of view if you know what I mean Jennifer wants to know if it's gonna be a trilogy it's not this is it life geek wants to know when is your deadline my deadline was October 2nd and I missed it and then I imposed on myself an artificial deadline of pizza mess because pizza miss that asks are there any McIlroy references in the book I mean probably well maybe I'll go back and add one just for you I will see there's a lot of Keanu referee is despot Seto in this book seat now this is the problem now I want to add despedido into the book kata asks have any current events and development in the social media internet discourse world changed the structure or focus of the sequel or given you a different perspective compared to an absolute remarkable a question yeah totally the first book was very much about what the internet is like right now or was like a couple years ago and this book is attempting to think about what the social internet might be like pretty far in the future book doesn't take place far in the future but the world is much more different in this book than it is from our world in the first book if that makes any sense at all hopefully it will make sense when you read the book what color will the cover be I think it's gonna be orange any new characters joining the man gang yes yes what's been the hardest thing with this book as I have alluded to the book is written from multiple perspectives so like a a bunch of the previous characters are now point-of-view characters they are writing the book themselves this it turns out as hard a voice is difficult and and to have like to store like four or five different people's voices in my head I have had to learn a lot which is great I mean that's part of why I like making any art is thinking really hard about it learning how it works watching other people do it really well knowing you're never gonna do it that well but then trying anyway man monster asks how do you feel and I feel really good like there were times that I didn't it was stressful a lot it was a lot of nights put in but I feel like I got better at stuff while I worked on it and so far I'm enjoying reading it as a revisionist and I hope that it will hit your bookshelves sometime within the next 12 months we'll just say that John I'll see you on Friday good morning John I just want to start off by saying to all the people who don't know about none pizza with left beef I'm here for you to bring you into the glorious new future you will experience within the next four minutes for those of us who know about non pizza with left beef come along with me on this journey there are better things in the world that none pizza with left beef but not very meant it was October 2007 a man goes to dominos dot-com where they have introduced a new feature that allows you to order pizza without talking to a human being and so for cheese this intrepid explorer chose none and for sauce likewise he ventured none and yet for beef he chooses normal and he chooses left I don't know what the non normal choices were that websites gone and the good people at Domino's did the only thing they could do they cooked some pizza crusts and just tossed some beef balls in their tumblr also launched in 2007 I'll remind you that the iPhone also launched in 2007 and also vlogbrothers it was an important year thing that we often forget about tumblr the thing that makes it really such a fantastic platform is that every time you reblog and add something that itself becomes content and that piece of content in the future cannot be lost it becomes attached to and is carried through with that media on to all the other places it will go but this one says 10 years into the future and I will still be laughing about this it's now 12 years in the future and I am still laughing about this and in the final edition someone orders nun pizza with left beef and the man at the Domino's calls her back and he says miss you can't do that but you can you can and you must I maintain that no one would ever call a Domino's and say I want nun pizza with left beef you need the interface between you and the person making the pizza so that you don't feel this weirdness similar vein a man recently ordered a cheeseburger and then took off all of the things until he was left with the cheese you cannot ask for and pay 99 cents for a cheese from a person it's not funny anymore it's only funny when you punch it into a screen and then you imagine that I think the person on the other end is also giggling a little bit thinking I guess I'm gonna make a cheese we will never again live in a world without none pizza and left beef and as long as I have neurons firing together I will have neurons dedicated to the existence of nun pizza with left be anyway John I finished my book why is there music playing I can't go outside and do a pizza miss dance there's a freaking blizzard [Music] [Music] I okay I forgot one of the stinking shirts at home oh my god my friend Garth no this is the shirt that I forgot to bring to the park it's maybe my favorite why I'm cold I like this one too that's nice that's very cool and yes I finished a draft of my book and it's the biggest news of my year and I didn't have time to talk about it because I was too busy talking about none pizza with left beef John if you want to ask me questions about it I'm probably gonna be talking about on Thursday John I'll see you tomorrow I mean I hope the books good but it's not gonna be as good as nun pizza with left bee good morning John I don't know if what people know about how I make videos but I usually write a script and this video doesn't have one of those I started to document it says good morning John that's the whole thing that's what I got basically a lot happening all at the same time the entire YouTube community is coming together to raise money to plant trees in the world which is lovely I just bought a bunch of land to build a warehouse on because dftba has grown too much which I don't mind because as I haven't I don't think even mentioned on this channel dftba now gives all of its profit distributions that would normally go to me and john to charity and also yes that's happened and we've already raised more than half of our initial goal of two hundred and forty thousand dollars at PIH org slash Hank and John have a big truck where do you do it where are you going he's gonna okay good and also it's just a lot to have finally had this thing that John mostly you but also I have been working on for a really long time and like been thinking about for a really long time this is something that we've been really careful about in that if we're gonna ask a lot of people for a lot of money and it also put a lot of our money on the line and we want to do it the right way and we want to have the best impact that we can now of course best is a trap that you can get stuck in right like is this the best possible use of money that's how you start thinking about things you will never do anything because what isn't the best possible use of money I know this for a fact is it sitting in my bank account that's what usually happens when people have money you put it you invest it in the stock market and then the idea is that like in the future that money will be worth more money and it will be but as I was getting lots of advice on what to do with money because this is like there's a whole industry of people who are advisors for people who have money what I was realizing was when I said like I just want to give the money away now there was a lot of like well wait like wait for the money to become worth more money and then give it away then it'll be more of a gift you'll give away more money and that made a kind of sense until I realized a really obvious thing poverty and illness and hardship are taxes that pay for nothing these things make it harder and less likely for people to find stability and contribute to their communities having your mother die is something that decreases your odds of finding stability for your whole life and my money doesn't disappear when it arrives in Sierra Leone that value grows in children and nurses and parents and communities it just grows in ways that I can't see or control the way I could if the money was in a bank account financial advisors don't love this line of reasoning because it doesn't make them any money there are no like highly paid charity donation advisers though that's a little bit what John and I are trying to do for some people just shoot us an email at Hank and John at gmail.com we can help you make the most of your dollars also to raise money for this we're gonna be going on more tours if you want to tell us where we should go there's a link to a map in the description you can click on where we should go it should be fairly self-explanatory also at complexly we're doing a pilot season where 2/3 of the way through right now so we've got 3 shows that we're making 3 episodes each of and we're putting them up history pop which is like exploring history through the lens of pop culture got a Deadwood episode and a Chernobyl episode up so far and then we've got stories retold which is like an all-ages animated channel where we retell fairy tales with like modern morals and then it hashed out and there's links to all of these in the doobly-doo we're confronting the complexities of communicating name 2019 journalism in its Twitter and its bias and its leaks and all this stuff so the staff is kind of doing all these projects at the same time as all of their normal things but I think that it's really cool and thanks to everybody complexly who's working their butts off and then pizza Miz is happening next week I got a big pile of Pete some of stuff right over there that you can't see yeah you don't know about this it's the time of year when John and I go back to like 2007 vlogbrothers and we make videos every day like we used to I'll be fine John because pizza miss starts next week I will see you on Monday give to Partners in Health or check out the pilots here good morning John first yes your last video yes this video is nothing to that leave me now click the card and go but if you've already seen that video John flags now we've recently started to sell 99% invisible merch at dftba.com which I love and unsurprisingly since it's a podcast about design the designs are good Roman Mars the creator of 99% invisible is known for many things but his most popular YouTube video is about bad flag design and John I live in a state that was voted third to last for bad flag design though the fact that Maryland was above us makes me suspicious of the entire process because do they want me to know what the flag looks like cuz I've looked at it and I can't tell but I'm willing to admit it yes the Montana state flag is bad every other state flag looks like this a seal even shows like a wall of glacier meeting a large body of water which literally doesn't happen in the state this is why in Montana we actually identified by our area code we only have one for the whole state so 406 everybody loves it also our old license plate design which is quite good but Roman Mars and his TED talk focuses on the flag of the City of Milwaukee which is bad it's so bad right it's a flag on it there's a flag on the flag it's bad design I love good design and Roman Mars makes the case that a good flag doesn't just represent civic pride it can increase civic pride and since that TED talk on alternative has arisen at least with a certain kind of Milwaukee and the kind of Milwaukee in who like you know watches TED Talks what and I don't want to make a bunch of enemies right now among my fellow microbrew loving friends the people's flag of Milwaukee is good design its iconic you can understand it from across the baseball stadium but and I'm not from Milwaukee so I'm not weighing in on this conversation as a Milwaukee and at all I'm just as from like the perspective of design it feels a little bit posh and it feels a little bit like it cares more about design than it does about a city because you know what I feel like when I look at Milwaukee's current bad flag like I look at that and I think that's bad design but I also think like compromise is the main thing that's being conveyed here it's the thing that we all too often these days call tics like oh yeah okay they had to get the shipping industry in the gear and the church and the beer and the baseball and the old flag and oftentimes what politics like yeah politics but it's actually synonymous for is like yeah I had to think about someone who wasn't me other people and that way the current Milwaukee flag it feels like earnest it feels kind of sweet and in that way it feels kind of Milwaukee this does not make it a good design and it does not make it a good flag there's neither of those things and I will say that like democracy is not incompatible with good design the US has an amazing flag it is very different from most flags but is still deeply iconic and very good and Pocatello Idaho went from this which to this which yes Pocatello well done though this was also suggested and you should have done it you should have just gone for it I guess I'm feeling after all this talk is that like a good design is about more than good design and a great flag needs to be simple but I don't think every place needs a great flag after all these days Pocatello blow in New York City out of the water John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John crisis what kind of crisis you want you want a constitutional crisis got a couple of those a week housing crisis sure essential crisis always find the crisis yeah scientists would like for you to panic let's just go over to Google and see if we could come up with a word and see if there's a crisis about it oh great Chiquita would like you to know what they're doing about the banana crisis so apparently we're having a crisis crisis a crisis of crises and I'm a proper middle-aged man so are you John we should know how to deal with this so here's like number one strategy avoidance so start out gotta listen to shaky shaky by daddy yankee you might find solace and other activities YouTube videos might be good for you poetry poetry YouTube videos potato plants or a friend or a dog what am I saying I'm saying the first you gotta find your shaky shake you got to connect with your self as like a living sack of thinking flesh which is amazing right it's beautiful and majesty and like as far as we know unique in the universe it's so isolating to be in a crisis right to think that everything's going terribly and it's just and you have no path forward and like yeah I recognize that these are real problems but it's not solving anything to be like just in a terrified state of pan I and one of the climate advocates who will say no and no I don't I don't think that panic will help but I think it would make sense to panic panic is it is a normal emotion to have in given the circumstances it's not the most helpful why I think that having all of these crises makes it harder to connect because it seems like all those things out there are more important than all of these things in here all of they're like taking care of yourself the valuing yourself and the valuing of the other people in your life am i reading a book about this right now sure sure yes so I'm thinking about it a lot and I'm very tired because I'm Australia hungover on too many V B's no I just didn't sleep enough I think that paying attention is important I think that engaging with it is important I think that there's a certain amount of constant connection like looking for dragging through trying to get the thing as the moment that it comes out so that I could just put two tweets in my mouth like the peanut M&Ms and I can't even chew there's so many in me that's I want to engage with the crisis but like or peanut M&Ms in your mouth at the same time and I know this from experience is not better than having two seventeen is too many unhealthy it's messy and it's not enjoyable here's my middle-aged man take just because we're not doing something perfect doesn't mean that we're not doing taking climate as an example here I know that the denial is discouraging I know that there have been a lot of deadlines crossed up to this point we have started down a lot of very promising interesting paths the fact that America is like down below nineteen ninety-five levels of carbon dioxide is wild I wouldn't have been able to tell you back then how we were gonna do it it's like nobody knows now how we're gonna get through our various messes we've got ideas that we won't know how we solved the problem until we solve the problem it's deeply important for me to feel like I can find a place between panic and complacency I know that place exists and here's how I find it I imagine that the problem is this huge mountain that we have to climb but we can't see the ground we can't see the path we can't see the time so all I can do is take one step that feels like it's in the right direction and encourage my leaders to take steps in those directions as well some except the reason we can't do this stuff is cuz we don't mean literally don't know how we're gonna solve problems until we solve them so we take the step and things get better we get a little higher up over the obstacle so my way is to remember that all of the crises so far were solved in ways we didn't understand they would be solved we couldn't have predicted that future we couldn't have predicted this whew and so when I think I don't know how to solve this problem that's always how it is we never know how to solve the problem we just thus far just work a lot as individuals as a collective and then we get there so far John I'll see you on Tuesday shake it baby Jackie Jackie Jackie Johnny take good morning John it's Hank on Tuesday coming to you from Melbourne Australia that is just behind this window here getting real close to the lamp job Friday actually it's not very pleasant sensation on my fingers you don't want to do this thing where they'd have like the Google autocomplete vlogmas pioneered that that was our thing and then everybody's stole it but anyway I'm not bitter creativity is shared everyone builds on what everyone else has done before we couldn't copy the work other people I couldn't say words I'm gonna modify my own idea I'm gonna go to twitter.com and type why is Australia I spelled it super wrong why is Australia performing what the hell I'm not good at geography but since when is Australia in Europe at this I believe this tweet is about your a vision look what is Europe anyway it's an idea why is Australia why is Australia the best forsake rock you know what be Radley what the Frick is psych Rock we're gonna find out together sign crime why is Australia so far away so continents interestingly are less dense rock that is floating essentially on top of the sort of jelly-like interior of the earth and how those giant rocks float around on the jelly ball of Earth is a fairly random process but like something that we've modelled pretty extensively I'm not a geologist but geologists do exist and you should ask one of them Gaby wants to know why Australia is so slow with moving releases like I need to watch hustlers are in or else I won't be a valid game I've also heard the Huskers is good and it is we're Ludacris that we live in this global world and we still do content releases by continent twitter.com is right here everybody knows about the thing you can't do this to us anymore Sigrid wants to know why Australia is so obsessed with fairies they got fairy floss that's cotton candy fairy bread which is the thing bread with sprinkles on it fairy penguins which is a kind of penguin fairy lights I don't know what that is the fairies which I'm going to assume our boats that you take two from one place to another oh my god it's not a boat this is way better than fake rock the magical mystery tree it says right here in the YouTube description the fairies is an international and unique concept so it's both international and unique but it's proven itself as one of the top TV series touring publishing DVD music and licensing properties in Australia well if I'm here to watch fairies on YouTube as a child this is the marketing language I'm looking for all right I'm gonna mix it up because you know what most people are just mad about Australian politics in this search so I'm just gonna search why is Hank green why is that green so oh gosh I've take it back all right well I think this counts as video I'm gonna go watch the fairies on YouTube and then maybe go edit my book on the banks of the Yarra River like a lucky little turd John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John it's Friday you know how caterpillars become butterflies well that is a lot any given caterpillar you spot honking its way down the sidewalk there's a 90% chance that that fresh little wiggler is incapable of becoming a butterfly and instead it will become a moth and John loss no my god they're so good what precisely is a moth you ask well here's where it gets a little bit messed up because butterflies are a thing they're like all they have a single common ancestor moths are just anything that's not a butterfly any scale winged thing that isn't a butterfly moth is it more closely related to some butterflies than it is to some moths doesn't matter moth and talk about a branding problem right butterfly is this beautiful word it spoon arises to flutter by and then moth it sounds like the noise you make when a moth flies into your mouth but moths mouths mouths moths moths we're stuck with the name let's just look at these beautiful creatures and what I want to talk to you about today is mostly the Regal moth why because of its caterpillar the Hickory Horned devil which looks like this you will never forget this caterpillar or probably its name because it has got brand power brand too strong now there are other horned Devils out there this is the largest of the Horned Devils it's from South America but the Hickory with its blue body and it's red horns why does it look this way well because it's basically a hot dog with legs it's very good eating it looks fierce but it's not it can't sting it can't bite it's not venomous it's not poisonous but it's too big to hide from raccoons and possums so it's got to make those fuzzy folk worry about their noses and toesies before grabbing on and taking a bite but lots of caterpillars don't become gigantic food bags in fact the Hickory Horned devil is the largest caterpillar in the US so why if it's so big because the Hickory Horned devil has to consume massive amounts of food because Saturnian moths which is this is one of it's like authorities of these guys do not have mouths once they become moths once this attorney and Caterpillar puke it will never eat again and so these caterpillars eat two to three times their own body weight in leaves every day growing in size over a thousand times in the course of a month they don't even digest the cellulose of these plants instead they basically juice the leaves in their guts this time-lapse footage by the way is from John the butterfly farmer and his channel is amazing there will be a link in the end screen and description males emerge from their chrysalis they fly sometimes for miles trying to sniff out a female with their extremely sensitive feathery antennae their job is to locate the female because the females job is to use all of its energy creating hundreds of very large eggs female regal moth does not fly until it mates and if it does not mate it never flies it just dies waiting they have to mate and lay their eggs within the seven days they have to live in their adult forms the strategy of Regal moths and other Saturn ID is that the moth phase exists only for meeting and breeding and to pull that off the caterpillar needs to be successful in storing fats and proteins before it pupate and so it has to get big and full of nutrients which makes it a perfect snack so it has to look ridiculously fierce pretty much anything would see this juicy boy and think that is not worth the risk which is also how most people feel about them even though they are completely harmless still be nice because they are a marvel even if they are a little terrifying John I'll see you on Tuesday the bizarre bees pin Club was so successful that this month and this is the only time we'll do this we're actually going to give you two pins both the caterpillar and the moth thank you to everybody who signed up and thanks both to the butterfly farmer and to Bart for letting me use their moth footage both channels are linked here good morning John a couple of days ago President Trump shared a former map of Dorian the Hurricanes projected path first hats off to the people at the NWS who do hurricane projections because the three-day forecast which is the most important for evacuations has been spot on for this entire hurricane and that has saved lives second the Sharpie mark see the president also said a few days ago that Alabama was like in the crosshairs of Dorian and this is something that would be a totally normal flub like people sometimes when they're talking say the wrong thing then probably president Trump maybe somebody else drew a little sharpie line on the map to like include a little slice of Alabama and then it was like a front-page story in a lot of places Sharpie gape trended on Twitter and people were suggesting maybe Donald Trump should be prosecuted for sharing false weatherdata that last one no it wasn't a predictive map it wasn't shared as a predictive map it was saying here's what we thought might have happened and we got lucky and that thing didn't happen but it is also very clearly weird think that newsworthy and important are synonymous they're not it's important that the Golden Gate Bridge didn't fall down today but it is not newsworthy because it's normal the first condition to whether something is newsworthy is whether it's abnormal is a sharpie gate important maybe as like an illustration of the degradation of the shared foundation of truth and the most ham-fisted way imaginable mostly from what I saw it was used as like a window into the inner workings of the president's mind and that's always gonna be guessing like we know that's all guessing but here's the thing I know it's easy to say that President Trump is bad at everything but one thing he really gets is attention and I think that pretty much everybody like even his supporters get that he prefers the spectacle of this whole thing more than the process of actually governor and so like two or three times a week we have some fresh spectacle that he is responsible for like it's at this point pretty clearly not a bug it's a feature this isn't to say that it's good for him like personally or for his reelection chances there's like 30 York from Herman patty rappers in this trash and testing to the fact that just because you like something doesn't mean it's good for you it's also not to say that spectacles are unimportant part of the process of governing is actually getting stuff done he's creating a shared story that people can believe in it's fighting for a particular store and theatrics are a good way to tell a story and people at the center of attention are the ones who are most able to shape a narrative and to some people these weird theatrics are exciting somebody draws a line on a map and suddenly everybody's exploding it fits into this narrative of like the press and liberals being ultra critical of Donald Trump by being abnormal Trump gets to always be in the spotlight and because he's in the spotlight he gets to craft a narrative like he's the producer of a reality TV show but the wild thing to me is the only story he seems to want to tell with this great power he has is one about himself one where he's the ultimate and only Savior one where everyone has to be loyal to him or else and one where he's always right even when like it's clear he made a mistake ultimately I think this is why we're so exhausted not just because like we remember a time back before we had to be paying attention to this and there was some fresh new spectacle coming out of the Oval Office every two freakin days but because the spectacle is ultimately always about the same thing it's pompous and it's selfish it's egotistical and it's smug he has a tremendous skill for controlling and crafting narrative but instead of using that for any kind of shared vision it's always only about himself and that's exhausting not because it's always in your face but because of how dangerous it actually is I don't know the way through here I'm just describing a situation if we don't treat abnormal things like their news then they just become normal but when the strategy becomes be abnormal for the sake of attention the only thing you can do is realize it and then like vote it out every time John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John last week I joined an extremely unexcusable of people who said that the Amazon rainforest produces 20% of the world's oxygen I've since deleted it from the video because it's a fake fact no one even knows where it came from all of the land plants on the earth combined produce around 25% of the world's oxygen the rest comes from the oceans mostly phytoplankton which are like teeny tiny plants except it turns out that we are imagining all of this incorrect the frame were in here indicates that if a phytoplankton and the plants stopped producing oxygen within a year we would run out we would not we would all die immediately if there was no o2 being produced that means there would be no photosynthesis and photosynthesis is where all food originates so we would stop everything would die but there would still be plenty of oxygen in the atmosphere so let's do this on introduction to the carbon cycle I guess cuz I of all people should know this plants use energy to turn carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen in a process called photosynthesis and then those carbohydrates get turned back into co2 and energy and that consumes a molecule of o2 if this happens inside an organism that's called respiration if it happens outside an organism it's called combustion I'm gonna lump those two together and call them both burning because I'm frustrated that there is no collective word that includes both of these things except for I guess oxidation which is just too broad this is just one of my science communicator beef we're sticking with burning fine carbohydrates are as Olive Garden has effectively capitalized on delicious they are unstable reservoirs of energy so on a geological time scale all carbs get burned when a carb gets burned that molecule of o2 that the plant produced gets sucked back up every single time it's a one to one cycle so now you're like okay Hank yes but like I can breathe so you're wrong you're right I was lying to you not every carb gets burnt here on land almost always there's oxygen around to do the burn in the oceans there's a fairly common exception sometimes phytoplankton can bloom so successfully that the organisms that consume them after they die eat up all the oxygen in an area and no oxygen is left for more burning the carbohydrate just falls to the bottom of the where it can never get burned this process upsets the balance between co2 and oxygen it's the reason I'm breathing right now the photosynthesis produces that oxygen but that oxygen doesn't get evenly distributed throughout the earth so there are some areas where the burning can't happen over time that results in a giant reservoir of o2 in the atmosphere so if the Amazon rainforest disappeared there would be less oxygen produced but over time they would also be less oxygen consumed because oxygen consumption and there's an asterisk here but like basically oxygen consumption only happens when plant material is burned either in a fire or in an organism since oxygen is abundant to the atmosphere carbon dioxide is the limiting agent in this carbon cycle which is why there's such a tiny amount of co2 in the atmosphere that carbon dioxide is what gets trapped and brought to the bottom of the ocean when these blooms happen they're over geologic time they're compressed from carbohydrates into hydrocarbons fossil fuels and when we burn those fossil fuels yes that consumes oxygen and we can see the oxygen concentration of the earth going down but it's not a big percentage of the total amount of oxygen in the atmosphere because there's a lot but the carbon dioxide concentration is extremely low and we are well on our way to doubling it and that's one of the very real reasons why it's a bad idea to burn rainforests the Amazon rainforest is a sink for something like 90 billion tons of carbon dioxide and that is a huge service that we need so we're not gonna suffocate very happy about that sounds miserable but I kind of wish we could see the threats to the other services that the earth provides to us as similarly significant because they are John I'll see you on Tuesday we're gonna be okay all right we're gonna make it through this good morning john so i've seen a bunch of tweets for the last few days that made me pretty angry which you know makes it exactly like every other few days in the last few years but in this specific case it was tweets like these the amazon rainforest is seeing a record number of wildfires large swaths of the amazon rainforest are burning fires are raging the amazon region is burning now mostly this comes down to like a problem i have with reality which is that there's just too much of it and thus it is very hard to be aware of all of it and so we end up with things that are incomplete making their way into our brain but if there's anything we should be aware of it's this because you know future of the planet at stake and stuff like that so why do i not like these tweets well because here in america uh where i live usually if there's a wildfire it was an accident and sometimes fires are okay because fires are a normal part of our ecosystems in america and sometimes they were done on purpose by like criminals who the government wants to arrest and so when you read these headlines as an american you think oh no a fire happened i hope someone's trying to put it out but in the amazon fire is not a natural part of the ecosystem and because of that many trees in the rainforest can't survive what we would in the u.s consider a trivial burn these fires are not natural they are intentional this isn't intentional like it's arson it's intentional like this land is more economically productive when we graze cattle on it than when it's the rainforest so the headline here shouldn't be large swaths of the amazon are burning it should be large swaths of the amazon are being burned now sometimes in the dry season which we're in right now there are natural wildfires in the amazon and in fact the number of natural wildfires appears to be increasing because here's a thing about the amazon and other rainforests with plenty of water and plenty of sunlight the ecosystem is really good at using everything that comes its way that means that most of the water that falls is immediately released back into the atmosphere by this tremendous amount of vegetation photosynthesis gets done when water evaporates out of plants a single tree can evaporate more than 50 000 gallons of water per year and once that water's back in the atmosphere it falls again rainforests don't just thrive on rain they make rain so when there's less rainforest there's less rain and more fires but that's not the real reason there's so many more fires this year it's not hotter than normal it's not drier than normal the thing that changed in brazil is who the president did the moment he was elected jair bolsonaro rolled back environmental protections in brazil earlier this month he fired the head of brazil's national space and research institute after he defended data showing that deforestation had grown 40 in the last year bolsonaro says that figure is wrong and the deforestation is down that's a lie when asked why there are so many fires this year bolsonaro said that maybe environmental organizations are setting them to make him look bad that is also a lie but this isn't just like pure malice and like love of destruction there's an ideology here there's the economic part of it which is just that there's a lot of value in the rainforest and no one's making any money off of it if it's just being rainforest and then there's sort of an ideological thing of like the civilizing interest of man we must bring our superior way of life to this wild jungle racist manifest destiny kind of stuff so to make the money you encourage legal logging and farming you reduce inspections reduce regulations and you ignore illegal land grabs where a forest is slashed and burned and then seeded with grass and sold to ranchers there's also another piece of the ideology here that i think is really interesting the reality is that most of the good that the amazon does is for everyone it produces oxygen for everyone it traps co2 for everyone it preserves biodiversity for the whole world but brazil isn't getting paid for any of that stuff far-right perspectives ultra-nationalist perspectives don't really allow for stuff that helps everyone goes against this ideology that the nation is for the nation only and here's where this gets super wild the fact that the rest of the world cares so much about the amazon rainforest isn't perceived as a reason to protect it it's perceived by these people as a threat it's like a claim on their sovereignty it's it's thought of as internationalization after all like legitimately what right do i as an american have to tell brazil what to do with its rainforests in america we have deforested everything we can so our interest in protecting it actually becomes a reason for some people to want to destroy it if you live in a world where everything is a zero-sum game why should anyone else benefit from our property and then there's the reality that the amazon is not as we sometimes imagine it empty there are many indigenous people other people who live and work in the forest and who rely on the forest for their livelihoods but those people are often not seen as real brazilians by these nationalists nationalism is exclusionary ideology and that's why fascism nationalism and racism so often walk together but here's the thing um of course if the if the amazon rainforest was 100 pasture land in soybeans that would not just be a disaster for the whole world it would be even more of a disaster for brazil itself see how hot it is in northern africa that's actually farther away from the equator than brazil is brazil receives more solar energy than saudi arabia but because of the rainforest it is much more cool this is the effect of that evapotranspiration the rainforest makes rain if there is less of it it is clear that it would be hotter and drier and these man-made fires or even the natural ones will spread on their own leading to a feedback loop that could end the amazon and 70 of the gdp of south america is made in places where amazon rainforest rain falls even here in america again internationalization for you much of the rain that falls here is evapo transpired in the amazon rainforest and an important note when i talk about rainfalling really what i'm talking about is agriculture i'm talking about food we eat that rain there's a lot of talk about tipping points and i think it's important to note that there are always many tipping points along the path to something being completely destroyed but yes there is a time when less and less water falls in the rainforest and fires happen more and more often and there is a time where we lose most if not all of the amazon and it's why we have science to warn us about stuff like this so that we can take action and it's why we have human rights to protect people whose land is their land whose life is their life but it is all too easy to deny stuff like this when you have more of an allegiance to your ideology than you do to the truth and that is something that i like to try and say to myself constantly it's why we need to call a lie a lie no matter who says it it's why we need to say that the rainforest is not burning it is being burned john i'll see you on tuesday obviously this is a big and complicated thing and this is a short video so i've linked to a bunch of other resources the article in the intercept from a few months ago that basically predicted all of this was my favorite resource for this but there are lots of other smart people talking about it and it seems like people are having a better idea of what exactly is going on and why it's happening so and i guess thanks for caring about this because because that's a big deal and it is the only way we have slowed this in the past good morning John it's Saturday what on earth am I doing here on statins I'm throwing a wrench in the whole thing I made a video yesterday about octopuses and now I'm back this isn't how it works except of course it is because John I'm here to tell you that I your brother Hank green love you thanks for being a good brother because it is esterday it is in fact the 10th yesterday if you can believe that this is what you look like when you are announcing the very first Esther day you were so young and beautiful and that hair you had to crop get to go down here your eyes keep them down here so they could fit the hair John I love you I've always loved you I've not always loved your hair I also love that for the last ten years we've taken a day of the year at the request of Esther Earl a nerdfighter an awesome person to tell the people that we love we love them not our internet faves not our crushes but our friends and family who we want to always be there for and who probably know that we love them and maybe we just assume that they know but that doesn't mean that they don't want to hear it and that it isn't actually good to say it out loud sometimes it's just really important and like after 10 years of doing it I realize how important it is I think sometimes that like tradition can get a bad rap because of course tradition comes from the old times and the old times were bad like mountains of cholera and irrational hatred bad and yeah because of that some traditions that we hold on to and we've sort of refused to modify because we're sort of like tied to the idea of the tradition itself can be sort of counter to our value and maybe I'm just getting old here but I think that the existence of tradition is very good like having a time every year to say thanks to your mom even if it was created by a greeting card company that's a good tradition it's been times in my life when I've kind of coupled those two things together like the idea of a particular exercise of a tradition and the idea of like the existence of tradition like repeatedly doing things for a reason that you believe in and I just sort of thrown them both out like I rebelled against the idea of tradition when I should have been rebelling against certain way of experiencing certain traditions Valentine's Day for me personally has always sort of seemed like a blah thing the way that people do it but I do like there being an opportunity for me to like a write a card to Catherine telling her that I love her and why and why she's so great but kind of because we don't like the traditional way of celebrating that tradition we kind of don't at all whereas maybe we should maybe we should find our own way of doing let's get a babysitter to just stay downstairs while we watch all of the Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice for the 85th time but Esther did when she requested that we celebrate her birthday by celebrating familial love was genius so somehow there wasn't a day for that that tradition didn't exist but it like needed to maybe in the past it didn't need to maybe it did but like it does because things are more true when we say them out loud and they're definitely more true when we hear them John I appreciate you so much you're a good person and a hard worker and a great dad I love you and I'm so glad that you're part of my life I love working with you and I love working to make our relationship strong I would literally never say any of that if there wasn't a tradition right but now ten years in it is a tradition for me and it's normal for me so to the people who aren't John whether this is your first or your tenth take some time send a text or an email or a phone call or a gosh-darn letter tell those people who you think probably know it already that you love them because even if they know they're gonna love hearing it John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John at your video about the time when you almost fail to class and then your teacher made you not do that reminded me of the time that exactly that same thing happened to me which maybe says something we'll get there and 11th grade I took a landscape design course so I learned about plants and how to plant plants and take care of them and arrange them in people's yards that class weirdly was at a different campus so after fifth period I had to get on a bus and go to a different school and sometimes I would not do that instead I would go sleep in the band room I skipped that class because one I wasn't taking it very seriously but to my school had a policy that if you got more than ten unexplained absences you'd fail the class but before that nothing happened so I kept very close track of my unexplained absences so that I would have exactly ten of because I was that kind of self-important egotistical churned out into the semester it wasn't more than ten it was ten the teacher told me that I would be failing the class and I got really mad and I wasn't mad at the teacher I was mad at myself for thinking I could be so clever and smart and being wrong about that and I think it helped me realize that I was just sort of taking it for granted that I would always be let off but regardless of any of that I was very pissed off and I went into the hallway I like walked out of the classroom and I kicked a locker door that was hanging open I was wearing steel-toed Doc Martens because it was the 90s and a locker door flew across the hallway like it just ripped off and flew away and now I'm thinking okay well I failed a class and I've destroyed school property so I'm in much more trouble I go back into the classroom everybody's looking at me and the teacher says out loud I'll mark it down is not so somehow John I went from failing a class then I destroyed property now I'm not failing what happened here even in that moment it felt wrong to me I didn't question it because that would have been a bad day headed home to tell mom about actually did a lot of kind of like bad stuff in high school and I did it knowing that it was like a risk but it wasn't a big risk and I remember back then thinking that I was just good at getting away with stuff why because you know I looked like this and I had good grades and I had so much potential you know that thing that people say is that's the thing you were humans we never stopped doing the math prejudice and privilege aren't a sign of like some kind of interior rot they're not a disease that monsters have their signs of biases that we all have and deal with yes sometimes racism is cruel and violent and intentional but sometimes racism is just that a white kid looks different to you kicking the door off a locker than a black kid does I think a lot of America's really stuck on this idea that racism is a secret disease that only monsters have there's a link to something that gene Denby wrote that helped me think a lot more correctly about this stuff and that says it better than I could but a thing I've been thinking about is it seems like the more you have the more people are wary of taking things from you and the less you have or are perceived to have the more society is okay with exploiting you or punishing you or just giving up on you I want a sociologist to explain this to me but it seems real seems like both a cause of increasing inequality and the kind of thing that only gets worse with increasing inequality and yeah it seems like it's the source of a lot of bad I'm really grateful to have been raised by parents and had mentors and teachers who helped me realize that I wasn't just some clever kid who is just so good at getting away with stuff cuz I still see people my age thinking they're that person and it's a bad look but that instead I just was a person who had a lot and so people were wary of taking it away and that among many things is a good thing to know and there are many other things that I think I still need to learn John I'll see you on Tuesday good morning John it's Friday I'm sitting here in my usual spot but with an unusual camera this is a VidCon 2010 flip camera there were like 10 or 20 of these made I actually did the design on the front of the camera thank you very much to barry car who got this flip cam at VidCon 2010 and gave it to me as a present in celebration of 10 years of VidCon it's like taking pictures of the polaroid camera it really feels like of another era for example I love that John among the many things that of course happened at VidCon the most important the thing everybody wants to see is yes I crushed the gush a while back I uploaded a video on vlogbrothers that was meant for Hanks channel it was like 4 minutes and 2 seconds long so I had to get punished and the punishment I settled on because of a weird thing that I have with gushers is that I would drink the gush juice turns out there's not a lot of juice per gusher so I needed help and I got it in the form of these nice people who squeezed gushers into cups for most of the live episode of dear Hank and John that we did on the stage at VidCon and then [Applause] so right there right that moment something interesting happened inside of my mouth I knew that it was gonna be very sweet but I didn't know that it's gonna be extremely sour like it's both but it it's very sour sensation is kind of a wait because it's it's kind of heavy and it doesn't like move around like water does so it's sort of like slap into my tongue the second sensation was my salivary glands responding to the sourness of it and immediately releasing the maximum amount of saliva that they could you got if you got a small rat but does that count if you don't swallow it just get it down oh it was like Jacuzzi Jets of saliva it was helpful though because it would have been very difficult to swallow with the gush because it's so thick without all that I had had liquid I was actually swallowing was like spit gush and then I went back I don't know cuz I was on stage and like people had worked really hard to squeeze all this gush out of gushers for a second helping questionable uh yeah and then like a piece fell off the top of the gush cup into my glasses which made me panic a little bit so I knew that drinking the gush was gonna be bad but I did not realize that having drunk the gush was going to be worse partially because my stomach was just very upset extremely acidic I would love to know the pH of gush juice crash came quickly and and lasted for the rest of the day and of course to my crew of lovely gush milkers you're the best thank you for your support additional things that are happening one John and I are going on a very short tour in Madison Wisconsin in Minneapolis Minnesota I'm gonna be live podcasts me and Katherine are gonna do one John and it's gonna do Anthropocene reviewed and we're gonna do a live dear Hank and John we're calling it a minute tour because it's a mini tour and also because Steve the Minotaur will be giving a short lectures more expensive tickets for people who want to meet us afterward and all the money we make is gonna go to support our communities work improving maternal health in Sierra Leone also scishow just released its first documentary film it's discussing whether Apollo was actually a good idea in celebration of Apollo's 50th anniversary and to celebrate that we've got a mission patch and we're also doing a new pin every month celebrating a different space mission we're starting off celebrating Apollo's two different colors they're standard and go in the dark they're the same price that's all the things can't wait to see people next month in Minneapolis and Madison John I'll see you on Tuesday there's gusher oh my glasses oh my god it's like still dripping off I guess these are the mouths gushers oh that's so horrible good morning John VidCon is next week so I'm super stressed out and not really able to concentrate on anything in particular nice thing though is that now I'm old and so I understand that this is happening and I know the solution very weird animals luckily the Internet is almost as good at sharing weird animals as it is at sharing celebrity drama and reality destroying rage lies I realize this recently while on Twitter and seeing this very good water anole it looks silvery because it has a thin bubble that clings to its super hydrophobic skin that bubble has oxygen diffusing into it and then it exhales into the bubble and inhales newly oxygenated air thus allowing it to stay underwater for more than 15 minutes so John I'm gonna start every once in a while sharing with you a bizarre beast of some sort to ease my own mind and maybe make us all feel better about our lives on this beautiful danger ball so let's start out with what about faves the mola mola or the ocean sunfish I love this fish so much you may recognize them from this video that thing is big J what is that thing it looks right for this video game or from a viral tumblr rant that I read from some philistine claiming this thing is so worthless it doesn't realize it shouldn't exist you that's not how this work the various species of sunfish are successful and you know how I know that because they were doing just fine before we started accidentally ripping them out of the ocean with the rest of our fish cat and throwing a bunch of indigestible trash that looks exactly like their favorite food into the ocean they eat jellyfish which is also the favorite food of a lot of sea turtles which made me think if there's some convergent evolution going on here because when you turn them all them all on its side it kind of has a very similar swimming style to a sea turtle almost as if there's a good reason for this ridiculous shape and yes I recognize that they look dumb in Taiwan they called them the fish that looks like a toppled car and the Polish name for them is basically just a head which I yeah I see it but just because it looks funny doesn't mean it's not a good fish broth they are the biggest of the bony fishes and they get very very big up to about a thousand kilograms up until recently we actually assumed from their lack of swim bladders and they're very weird fins that they were themselves a kind of plankton that they would just go wherever the ocean currents would take except it turns out they can actually swim pretty fast in fact the only people who have ever been hurt by sunfish were hurt when sunfish jumped out of the water and into a boat but that's when they're relatively young when they're less young they are not very fat they're pretty slow but because they don't need to be fast because they're so big and they have fecundity proportionate to their size a female adult sunfish can lay up to 300 weight for it million eggs for clarity that is more than the entire world population of adult sunfish sunfish are called sunfish because they Sun themselves they lay flat on the water either to warm themselves up so that they can go back down deep and get cold again or because they want seagulls to come and peck worms off their side maybe both maybe neither but weirdly baby sunfish also kind of look like sons with you know like a super gross eyeball inside of them and they grow extremely fast the Monterey Bay Aquarium had a sunfish for 15 months that grew from 50 pounds to almost 900 pounds it was so big that couldn't fit it in the tank anymore so they had to airlift it by helicopter to freedom birth to adulthood mola mola increase in mass by more than 60 million times and John their skeletons look like very dangerous spaceships yeah I get it other animals are cute and fuzzy and they look like they're smiling at you and mullah bowl I have their big terrified eyes locked into a bumpy head and can't fully close their mouths and have huge amounts of parasites both in and around them but we have no idea what's going on in that big dopey head body and I just want all of the mola mola in the world to know I love you you're doing great keep being lumpy and magnificent John I'll see you on Tuesday [gentle music playing] Good morning, John. In a single drop of water, thousands of organisms can live and thrive. An ecosystem, all on its own, in a space the size of your fingertip. Varied, peculiar, intricate, and magnificent. There's so much we know about these minuscule beasts, but also, many mysteries left. Often, we talk about exploration like going deep, or high, or far, but there is a whole other world, within an arm's reach, that, nonetheless, exists outside of our notice. The world of the microcosmos is as close as we have ever gotten to something truly alien. [gentle music playing] Microscopic animals living beside single celled giants. Diatoms with cell walls made of glass, massive amoebas oozing, ancient mutualistic relationships' astounding mysterious abilities. I can't quite explain why I am so astounded by this life. Maybe it's because it was - for almost all of human history- completely invisible and unknown. Maybe because its discovery transformed how we saw, not just life, but ourselves and led directly to the improvement of billions of lives. Maybe it's because it gives us a glimpse at cellular machinery, the chemical basis for the majesty of life. Or, maybe it's just because it's really ... pretty, and these organisms are our neighbors, and I want to know more about them. But, whatever it is, I am fascinated by it, and I watch a lot of YouTube videos showcasing this wonderful world. And then I got so obsessed that I reached out to one of my favorites, a guy named James who lives in Poland, and I asked him if he wanted to work together with me on a YouTube channel. You can find his videos primarily on Instagram. There's a link in the description. But, we've been working on a channel together for the last few months, and, John, it just launched, and I love it. It's called,  'Journey to the Micocosmos. ' Our first episode is out, and we'll have a new one every week. It features original music from Andrew Huang, and great design and editing from our people here at Complexly. Some of the organisms we feature might be familiar, like we're planning on following a family of tardigrades as they hatch and grow and develop. Some, will almost certainly be unfamiliar. But we hope that you will come to love and appreciate them as much as we do. Like Stentor coeruleus, one of the largest single-celled organisms on Earth, big enough to be seen with the naked eye. It's big, and beautiful, and voracious. The  'blue whale ' of pond scum. There's so much to see. So much to know. And  'Journey to the Microcosmos ' will take us there. Not rapid fire educational, like a lot of the stuff I've done before, but chill and laid back. 'Cuz that's how I'm feeling sometimes these days. Though this is not to say there won't be drama. So You can watch here and subscribe here. It's a very different thing than I have done in the past, so I really hope you like it. John, I'll see you on Tuesday. [gentle music playing] good morning John remember how I wrote a book this is all of the languages it's been published in so far that's the coolest thing I own that book will at some point in the future have a sequel and I've been working on that sequel so I've been thinking about writing a lot lately and this has made me realize that there are a number of things that I wish that I had known about writing when I was writing my first boss of course isn't going to be applicable to everybody but I figured I'd share with the help of some questions I got on Twitter number one characters versus plot I started with plot and I thought that plot was gonna carry me through the whole process I was super raw I couldn't even really get deep into the book until I cared about the characters really deeply I had to love them like friends in order to have the motivation to finish telling their story so like as far as writing motivation goes my like biggest tip is fall in love with your characters that's all it's the only thing that kept me going think number two writing schedules are not a thing that I have sometimes I'm pretty busy sometimes I'm not sometimes I'm sick but if I do not write at least a thousand words a week the story leaves my brain I no longer think about it in the shower when I'm taking a walk and starting back up again becomes a whole process for me a thousand words just like one or two hours of writing time and if I don't make that time I'm not reading the book anymore and I might not write again for months number three also regarding the actual physical process of writing not all writing is writing thinking staring researching stressing reading other people's books reading your own book again reading stuff that you've already written all that stuff is right in if you're super focused on word count you'll have more words if you're super focused on story you'll have more stories think number four relatedly nothing but time writes a book I don't know how I didn't know this but it takes hundreds of hours at least and so if you don't spend the time it doesn't get done think number five plotting for me is a process of constant retcon I don't know how other people do it but I'm writing and then I realized that something earlier in the story doesn't make sense or isn't necessary or is too loose and then the first book I would go back and fix that which was terrible one because like I might get further into the story and then have to go back and fix that exact same thing again takes a thousand years to look it up and fix it you out of your flow so the second book I just created a folder in my project file and it's called things to chain and it's just full of stuff I need to change so that I don't miss it in revision think number six the characters have to be in control if I'm controlling them then they aren't real and they're not gonna feel real thing number seven oh my god why didn't I know this you don't have to write linearly time around if I'm excited about a scene I'd go and I write that scene and it doesn't matter if it's gonna take place like at the last quarter of the book and I'm in the first quarter when I eventually fill in all the gaps like there's definitely gonna be things that I have to change about that scene but also everything that I've written up to that point is gonna mesh better with that final destination and even more importantly sometimes a scene you're really excited about their big scenes they're important scenes they turn out that they don't work and like then if you write up all the way to that scene just to get to that scene and it doesn't work it's a disaster so for me it's been really good to know if my important scenes are actually gonna work before I get to them and finally thing number eight I have expertise 'iz and passions if things that I love and that I care about and that I know about I've written like a thousand non-fiction video essays I'm kind of an expert on social media I don't know how I hadn't figured this out but like using my expertise and my passions has been deeply enabling and all of my early failed attempts at other books was because I wasn't doing that so John thank you for the years of practice here and if I could give you any advice it's apparently right a soccer novel I'll see you on Tuesday I don't have any news regarding the sequel right now but I am working on it if you want to hear me talk more about writing I have a very long video over on Hanks channel where I answer many more questions that I was sent on Twitter and also the book boxes from life's library usually make more of those than we're probably going to need just in case anybody needs some replacements but we're releasing a bunch of those on discount at dftba.com if you want to check that out good morning john we're gonna do nuance today it's the internet so i don't know how this is gonna go i recently had a tweet go viral no not that one or that one i've had a lot of tweets going viral lately this one it's a quote tweet of a tweet that referenced an infographic of coal use in the uk over the last eight years that was the sentence and my response to this like very good-looking news was like we can do this except slightly more vulgar than that because it's twitter and when you've only got 240 characters to work with you have to be more attention-grabbing one might say maybe a little more vulgar more outraged but that's a topic for another video my point is that we're facing a climate crisis and a lot of people talk about how like the solutions are impractical or impossible but we can do this like look the uk used to be like the center of the universe of coal and now there are some days when they don't produce any coal-fired power at all so we can do this or can we here's another graph what really hit coal and the nuts in the uk was natural gas and this is great because natural gas is a cleaner fuel and it also produces less carbon dioxide per megawatt of energy produced like we would produce way more carbon dioxide in the u.s if there weren't suddenly a bunch of cheap natural gas that's kind of putting coal out of business now obviously renewables like wind and solar are part of this as well but natural gas is a really important bit and the reason that natural gas got cost competitive compared to coal is hydraulic fracturing or what we call fracking which is in environmental circles considered to be universally a bad thing and like it is bad it's bad for local environments it uses a huge amount of water it comes with a risk of spills it impacts wildlife there are potential health hazards and if done poorly methane gets released in the atmosphere and methane is itself a greenhouse gas but then again natural gas is also a really good complement to renewables like wind and solar that don't necessarily track their power production to when the power is needed unlike coal-fired power plants which have to be on all the time natural gas plants can be easily turned on and off and that allows them to pick up their slack when demand spikes at certain times of the day or if it's just not very windy or sunny in the long term there are other ways that we might solve this problem but right now natural gas is a really good way to solve it and it makes the transition to renewables much easier now there are regulations that can decrease the potential negative effects of fracking but there are no ways to completely eliminate the negative effects it's just not a possible thing but i say over and over again that climate change is like the biggest challenge that humanity has ever faced the ways that we're gonna mitigate that problem are going to in themselves have environmental impacts and that's not necessarily a super comfortable thing to think about or talk about of course in a four-minute video i'm not gonna decide whether fracking is like ultimately good or ultimately bad i think that that depends on how and where it's done and it's also obviously not a long-term solution it's a bridge to get us to the future we need to be in i just think it is far too easy to create a villain that is like sort of standing in the way of some magical solution that isn't really there but this transition while it's going to take a long time has to be done as fast as possible and the fact that coal in the last 10 years has become an economically unviable way of making power at least in america is huge it is very good news and it is something that was largely brought to us not entirely but largely brought to us by hydraulic fracturing that's something that i the guy who is often you know like mad at all fossil fuels have to think about and like include in my world view and in my imagining of the path forward out of this mess john i'll see you on tuesday "}
